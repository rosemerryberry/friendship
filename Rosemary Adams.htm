PLOT</br>go</br></br>2011-11-08 09:42</br>Rosemary Adams</br>okay, in the first prophecy, it can't be as blunt as it is. it should be something waaay more mysterious, like....she who can fly will be the leader or something. but not that part about revealing it to her friends, that should be her own thing. </br>also, silverman must be ultimately nerdy</br></br>2011-11-08 09:44</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>uhuh I see, yeah the details of the prophecys can be ironed out in he writing process</br></br>2011-11-08 09:44</br>Rosemary Adams</br>second prphecy is also way to obvious. it should be a prophecy of one moment in the battle where the goblins are about to do something evil to brooke, cuase she derped and got kidnapped, and in order to break their evil bond, he has to do something ultra powerful, but at a cost. but even more cryptic. then, silverman is avoiding brooke to make her not feel guilty or nervous, so when that moment in battle happens and he looses his horn, she's all epic monoloug over your dying body time.</br></br>2011-11-08 09:45</br>Rosemary Adams</br>then, we can proceed further into the demons lair and retrieve the apple for silverman.</br></br>2011-11-08 09:46</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>but silverman dies earlier!! in the gazebo</br>i guess we couldmove it later,, thisll take deliberation</br></br>2011-11-08 09:46</br>Rosemary Adams</br>then, we get home all tired and stuff and we can be all sad and at his funeral and stuff, but then a horse appears and you know. is silverman. </br>it doesnt make sense for brooke to kill him with his own horn that he kind of gave up at a random and not really nessecary point in the story.,...</br></br>2011-11-08 09:47</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>oh on we decided that that was the way you gaveup your power, you give up your horn... and then you have to use it to kill yourself... to take the power</br>retrospect that may be unnecessary</br>okay so. We change the phropecy to be a vision of the future for silverman we see brooke get captured, but then someone cuts in andis like you're the only that can save her blah blah</br>later we see her begin to get captured (show vry beginning of clip we used for phropecy) but then have silvermna yell stop!</br></br>2011-11-08 09:48</br>Rosemary Adams</br>yepppp pretty much. details of what will be revealed in the prophecy can be revealed later. </br></br>2011-11-08 09:48</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>sacrifices his horn, we stab evil demo, brooke monologues done</br>okay this could work</br></br>2011-11-08 09:49</br>Rosemary Adams</br>actually, i was thinking like a kind of supercharged lightening bolt would come out of his horn, thereby making it disintigrate, so he actually does "sacrafice" his horn forever. </br></br>2011-11-08 09:49</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>you sir are changing too many things</br></br>2011-11-08 09:50</br>Rosemary Adams</br>also gandalf should be annes husband. cause she's a witch and he's a wizard...get ittttt?</br></br>2011-11-08 09:50</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>the point is that he sacrifices his horn so that we can use his unicorn power to kill the demos, which we can't without the power</br>also... no.</br></br>2011-11-08 09:50</br>Rosemary Adams</br>hey, i am not!!! I didnt participate in the making of this at all missy!!!</br>so....we should find an attrractive gandalf instead of your dad...anne would be pleased....</br></br>2011-11-08 09:51</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>like whoooooo</br>gotta think logistically</br></br>2011-11-08 09:51</br>Rosemary Adams</br>.......making sense....use english por favor.</br></br>2011-11-08 09:51</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>... i never used spanish</br></br>2011-11-08 09:52</br>Rosemary Adams</br>i'm tired honey. short words.</br></br>2011-11-08 09:52</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>i also I don't remember typing like whoooo, at all. so disregard that lol</br>oh wait.. i meant like who, never mind i got it</br></br>2011-11-08 09:52</br>Rosemary Adams</br>ohhhh okay that makes more sense....also....logistically?</br></br>2011-11-08 09:52</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>more logically</br></br>2011-11-08 09:53</br>Rosemary Adams</br>but...i am thinking logically.....the changes i proposed to trial three wouldn't affect the rest of the story!</br>oooooooops nevermind. lead demon. horn.</br>i see now.</br>hm.</br></br>2011-11-08 09:54</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I was just refering to we gotta thik about who we have availael for acting</br>available*</br>but also that</br>gotta stab the demon with the horn</br></br>2011-11-08 09:54</br>Rosemary Adams</br>maybe a supercharged blst that makes his horn fall off? thereby using its powers to save brooke AND kill edemon?</br></br>2011-11-08 09:54</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>maybeeeee</br></br>2011-11-08 09:55</br>Rosemary Adams</br>cause we have to really make there love instense, cause she does sacrafice her horn to be with him.</br></br>2011-11-08 09:55</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>haha and to turn the apples back! originally she didn't have that part but i thought that was retarded so i made her do it for a good reason tooo</br>yeah, so he gives up his horn to save brooke, and unicorn kind</br>we just have to work ot the logistics of how that happens</br></br>2011-11-08 09:56</br>Rosemary Adams</br>yeah...but thats far away...we still have a lot of intro to do.</br>also, confusion on the demon story we can work out at lunch.</br></br>2011-11-08 09:57</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>haha we haven't done much specifics on that, basically tells the back story of the wr of the demos and unicorns</br>and ho they're jealous of the unicorn apples</br></br>2011-11-08 09:57</br>Rosemary Adams</br>yeah, i got that, but its way of being introduced confuses me. maybe its just me.</br></br>2011-11-08 09:59</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>we juct kinda find it in the field, maybe we cold have somebody be like this was my favorite book when I was little! read read read=story</br></br>2011-11-08 09:59</br>Rosemary Adams</br>we'll figure it out. love you darling, time for sleepy night night</br>(^^^)</br>bait hoo hah hah</br></br>2011-11-08 10:01</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>alrighty bye bye</br>im starting the script fyi....</br>also we're all just talking like real people</br></br>2012-04-24 04:07</br>Rosemary Adams</br>http://shop.nordstrom.com/s/adrianna-papell-tiered-chiffon-gown/3106871?origin=category&resultback=1220</br></br>2012-04-24 06:25</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>omggg i want it<br />its beautiful</br></br>2012-10-28 02:30</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>http://i.imgur.com/5SO6R.jpg</br></br>2012-10-28 02:41</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xz43LQRZegE&feature=plcp</br></br>2012-10-28 02:42</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>hehehe<br /></br></br>2012-10-28 10:26</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Hahahahahaha!</br></br>2012-11-07 10:59</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Zoe I want to make that picture my profile picture so badly.....</br></br>2012-11-07 11:00</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>It's so beautiful.... but it wouldn't be very subtle</br></br>2012-11-07 11:01</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Nope.

It got waaaay stronger towards the end.</br>You need to make sure that everything connects back to your thesis.</br>Like, the evidence and analysis of the evidence is there, but why you chose to examine what you did isn't always very clear, and how it relates back gets pretty lost at points (in my opinion)</br></br>2015-06-10 12:16</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Yeah I changed my thesis to what my teacher recommended, (the stuff about black people having no home essentially) and then mixed all my paragraphdbup found icantly but didn't change that much within them</br>So i think it got a little lost</br></br>2015-06-10 12:17</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Yeah, I get pretty particular so I'm sure you'll be able to fix it</br></br>2015-06-10 12:17</br>Rosemary Adams</br></br>2015-06-10 12:17</br>Rosemary Adams</br>type type type</br></br>2015-07-02 09:02</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I'm aliiiive</br>So far I've been having mood swings like I've never had before, but Matt is doing a good job if taking care of me. </br>Theres a rocky beach along the river pretty close to us and so we have made that our make out spot.</br>Tonight Matt has to check if my IUD string is in the right place, neither of us are very excited for that.</br>How's life in Sammamish?</br></br>2015-07-02 09:47</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>haha it's good, I'm glad you found a make out spot.</br>I wrote you a letter today detailing all my recent exploits, but I was just going to keep it until you sent me your address haha</br>its long</br>and I haven't even done that much, I just had a lot of thoughts</br>I'm doing homework, lots of homework...</br></br>2015-07-02 09:50</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Heres an address, 615 Whidby Ave <br />Port Angeles, WA <br />98362</br>It's Matts dads place, I'll pick it up from them so address it to me</br>Are you and keegan having fun?</br></br>2015-07-02 09:52</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>okedoke, prepare for long letters, its basically me just telling you all the random things I would tell you if you were here, like a one-sided chat, if you will</br>and yeah we went to a barbeque yesterday ar his friends house which was cool, he talked to us for a long time about his work for oculus on these virtual reality goggles, its actually really cool</br>They roll with a really smart crowd</br>he's at an "intern hunger games" tonight put on by microsoft so whatever that means</br>but yeah he actually makes me feel dumb sometimes which I don't like but its basically just because I don't understand all the technical terms used in software and mechanical engineering, and can you really blame me? So its not the end of the world</br>plus he's a dunce sometimes</br>Also I've never had more fun telling people where I work, I feel cool</br></br>2015-07-02 09:58</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Hey, being close to someone who is smarter than you is a struggle sometimes, it's not always good for ones self esteem. But as long as he isn't condescending about it then there isn't much to do except bask in his glorious knowledge.</br>Oh yeah, hows the epilepsy lab?</br></br>2015-07-02 09:59</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I also don't think he's actually smarter than me, he's just more educated in some areas, but I"m not really used to that so its interesting</br>its cool! I started today, I phosphorylated some MIPs</br></br>2015-07-02 10:00</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Didn't we just talk about people not knowing technical terms? ;)</br>Anyways, I gotta run, we are having a fire down by the river. See yah later brainiac :)</br></br>2015-07-02 10:01</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>hahaha I learned them today too, basically selected a bunch of proteins that read specific portions of DNA and then prepared them to read that DNA by phosphorylating them (adding a phosphate group to the 5' end (throwback IB bio) so that the DNA primers can bond)</br>haha have fun by the river, adios</br></br>2015-07-12 05:07</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Alright prepare to get a long message, but me and Keegan are in weird place and I want to talk to you about it so I'm just gonna write you a facebook letter</br></br>2015-07-12 05:22</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Okay so basically me and Keegan don't have sex anymore. That's not really true but its been legitimately 2 weeks since we had actual sex and like a week since we had anal sex lol which I only kind of count, and I am pretty unsatisfied with that. We still cuddle a lot but that's about it, we don't even really kiss or anything that often, so it's been a struggle. <br /><br />(In other news I'm really digging my vibrator, it took some getting used to but it does some interesting things to me. I'm not sure if I'm orgasming (?) but it definitely does something that I enjoy so that's been fun. but I would still rather have sex with an actual person that I care about so still frustrated.)<br /><br />But so i talked to him about all this this morning, and basically it hearkened back to that first talk we had a while ago about how he doesn't like having sex that often. My libido is just higher than his is, and he just doesn't mind this frequency of sex and there's really no non-rapey way for him to have sex if he doesn't want to so there's really no way of resolving this issue, except for me to just be kind of unhappy for the course of our relationship. I certainly don't want to break up with him over this.<br /><br />But this conversation proceeded to evolve into talking about how we are feeling about our relationship in general. And basically he said that while he cares about and loves(?) me now he doesn't see us getting married, and doesn't think we'll be together for years or anything and I don't remember his exact words but it was something along the lines of that he felt like our relationship was on it's way out. But saying that he also said that he doesn't want to break up now or at any time in the immediate future. And so it's not like I really saw myself getting married to him or going out with him that long, I was kind of just considering breaking up with him at the end of summer, at least so we could take a break or something, it was still really hurtful to hear him say that, and I don't know why he would want to say that if he didn't want to break up, it certainly felt  a little bit like we were breaking up but then as usual it turned around and we talked about it and I still care about him and don't want to break up with him but I just feel really weird.<br /><br />Also we never fixed the love thing, I told him I loved him once, which he responded to but he still never actually like looks at me and says "I love you" the only assurances are the vague "it doesn't mean I don't love you" sort of things which really don't count to me but whatever. Also I don't think he's attracted to me, and I don't know how to get around that one but I've kind of started starving myself again which I am trying not to do because it is really not helpful but I can't always control my subconscious. He even knows I'm doing this and still wont compliment me or comfort me in any way.<br /><br />It's hard, things were actually going really well between us for a while, where I felt like I was actually in love with him and that he felt similarly, we had a good streak, but I just don't know what we're doing anymore. But I am too afraid of being alone to break up with him, because all I do is homework and hang out with him. And right now that's keeping me busy, I don't really feel particularly bored or lonely. But I'm dependent on him for my happiness which I don't like, because I can't break up with him, not that I immediately want to, but it's scary because if I decide I want to I know I can't.</br></br>2015-07-12 05:29</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>And in unrelated things about keegan that bother me. In comparison to that other stuff this really isn't that important but I thought it was ridiculous. So we were smoking from the bong last night and he was like this is really dirty, and I was like, yeah we should probably clean it. And so afterwards I was looking for the isopropyl alcohol to soak it or whatever and I couldn't find it so I was like I'll buy some tomorrow and we can clean it. And then he was like "if only we had some other alcohol!" (sarcastically) and so remember that vodka that was leftover on my counter for a while, he *really* wanted to pour that into the bong to clean it, and I was like "no." because I thought that was stupid. But he ranted for like ten minutes about how it was better for the ebnvirobnment because then we could clean the bong with the water and then *pour the vodka out and drink it because then we wouldn't waste the alcohol or the THC* which I thought was ridiculous, and was completely against. But I was tired of hearing about it so I was like "whatever, if you want to drink my vodka out of the bong you can" so he proceeds to actually do this. but of course he mixed it with a lot of water, and then used the tiny bit of vodka which didn't make any difference in the cleanliness of the bong because we would need like a whole bottle, and then actually drank like one sip of the dirty bong vodka water and was like it's not too bad.<br /><br />I was just kind of annoyed and a little flabbergasted by the whole situation, but I'm still a little mad he decided to use my vodka for that.</br></br>2015-07-14 11:56</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Breaking news! we had sex this morning, there was like 2 minutes of foreplay and it lasted like 5 minutes... but I'll take it! So that's good, now I just wonder if it'll be another two weeks....</br></br>2015-07-14 01:28</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Zoe I don't think Keegan is good for you.</br></br>2015-07-14 03:42</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>i mean, maybe. I was in kind of a bad place when I messaged you that, generally we still get along well and hang out a lot though and its fun so I don't know</br></br>2015-07-18 04:45</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>So fun facts me and Keegan broke up</br>It actually went super well, A+ breakup. We're going to actually stay friends though</br></br>2015-07-18 05:42</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Oh man so I was feeling really good about it but once we went our separate ways it feels real and now thinking maybe I made a mistake oh noo. I liked kissing him 😢</br></br>2015-07-18 06:14</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br></br>2015-07-18 06:16</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>man is this what breakups feel like? I can't imagine how it goes when its actually shitty or one sided. but I'm feeling the crushing weight of my loneliness and failure</br>probably should have waited until after my chem midterm</br></br>2015-07-18 08:26</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I'm re-opening my tinder, i think that's the best thing to do at this juncture</br></br>2015-07-18 08:43</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>feel better already</br></br>2015-07-18 10:15</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Omg I matched with that Asian dude from evergreen that's been hitting on me for years 😅</br></br>2015-07-18 10:55</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>oh man this was the best decision I could have made. quote from andrew: "yeah I was and still am highly attracted and interested in ya"</br>I hope you enjoy riding this rollercoaster ride that was my night of breaking up with my first boyfriend. I wish you were here though :(</br></br>2015-07-18 11:05</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>WERE GOING ON A DATE</br>this feels kind of fast</br></br>2015-07-19 11:22</br>Rosemary Adams</br>God this is the best series of messages I have ever recieved. I'm glad your first break up went well, although I admit I'm not sure about this whole staying friends thing. I'm very proud of you, and I wish I could have been there. Breaking up is hard and it sucks a lot, but I really think it was the right choice.</br></br>2015-07-19 01:35</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Haha I'm glad you enjoyed them,  and I think we actually are going to stay friends though. What really broke us up was that we really didn't have a romantic relationship anymore and we both acknowledged that and realized that what we actually had was a friendship, and so in some ways we can keep doing what we already were doing and just shift the labels. Because on paper we look like we would get along super well, we have a lot of similar interests and activities and in a lot of ways we do get along well, but in a relationship we had different expectations that led to a lot of problems. So I think friendship is feasible, but I'm not quite sure yet how that is going to actually manifest</br></br>2015-07-19 01:42</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Also happy birthday!!! Got any plans? Go drink in Canada?</br></br>2015-07-21 02:54</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Ugh remind me why I broke up with Keegan</br></br>2015-07-21 09:47</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I got your letter today! I wish you got my letters, but I think I've told you most of their content by now anyways. I think I'll stick to just facebooking you my news since it seems more reliable</br></br>2015-07-21 09:55</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>In other news me and Keegan have continued hanging out, we hung out yesterday until like 3:00 am but we don't have sleepovers anymore, and we're actually hanging out right now. It's kind of confusing tbh, because it's like nothing changed but we're not together, but then why did we break up? Ughh. Also I've continued chatting with some guys on tinder but I feel to weird about things with Keegan to really go forward with any of them.</br></br>2015-07-21 09:56</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I miss youuu, my life is too confusing to sort out on my own right now.</br>PS I met alaina's kitten and it was amazing</br></br>2015-07-22 08:03</br>Rosemary Adams</br>You broke up with Keegan because he was a shitty boyfriend! Matt and I just got back from a 20 mile, two day hike, that was pretty exciting. We are going to Canada next "weekend" (tuesday/wednesday) and I made $200 in tips in one day so I'm buying drinks ;) he got me a massage for my birthday and that was wonderful and also a very good idea on his part. I miss you too, I had a really bad bout of homesickness a couple days ago. ❤</br></br>2015-07-22 08:03</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Whens that date with tinder/evergreen guy?! I think you should do it. Being friends with keegan will work better if you dont want to bang him. </br>In my opinion anyways.</br></br>2015-07-22 08:32</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>yeah but he wasn't really a bad boyfriend, I'm realizing a lot of the problems we had were genuinely kind of my fault. and I don't know I haven't talked to Andrew since that night but I told him we should wait like a week because i didn't want to immediately want to start dating someone new, plus I have two midterms this week and enough on my mind</br></br>2015-07-22 08:34</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>and we hung out the last two days but we are probably not going to hang out at all over the next week-ish and so I'm not sure if we'll ever start again, we'll see. I'm still really attracted to him so being friends is kind of weird, but the lack of sex was also killing me, but I think I'm being over dramatic on that one, a lot of couples have sex like once a month and stick it out so idk</br></br>2015-07-22 08:35</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>also i matched with Cajun (like, paige's cajun) and I think it is hilarious and slightly bamboozling, but we haven't talked or anything yet</br></br>2015-07-25 04:11</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>hey buddy, so new updates: I'm getting dinner with Andrew on monday, so that should be interesting. I have another date with another guy I met on tinder next friday which i am a little bit more nervous about. One of the other guys I'm chatting with (I'm blowing up tinder these days) happens to work at the same lab as Brody (the one I dated for a bit) which is a funny coinydink, he's one of my favorites but we haven't set up a date yet so we'll see what happens</br></br>2015-07-25 04:15</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>also I literally haven't spoken to Keegan since we hung out last Tuesday so this whole "staying friends" thing is falling apart. I think the real test will be if he invites me to teriyaki tuesday on tuesday, because that's something we did with his mom every week since we've been home for summer (what we did last tuesday) so basically my thoughts are if he doesn't text me for that I can consider us officially not involved in each other's lives anymore. which isn't the end of the world but is just kind of sad</br></br>2015-07-25 04:16</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I got dinner with Silverman the other day, and I'm going to the EMP with sara tomorrow, so I think between silverman, sara and  random tinder dates I will be able to keep pretty busy</br>also Ryan (from the dm) messaged me today haha so we're catching up, that's been interesting</br></br>2015-07-25 07:52</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>You know what I'm gonna refine that and say that talking to Ryan has been delightful, I didn't realize I actually kind of missed talking to him haha</br></br>2015-07-25 10:19</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>in other news I just did 15 ALEKS topics in one day, that was fun</br></br>2015-07-26 12:03</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Oh also my letters came back because apparently they didn't have sufficient postage, so don't worry about ever getting those, at this point they're hilariously out of date anyway</br>Also I feel the need to mention that I love that Melissa posted on your wall that she private messaged you</br></br>2015-07-26 10:29</br>Rosemary Adams</br>The internet here is so spotty, I can't see anything but messages as far as facebook goes. I'm sorry staying friends with keegan didn't work out, but it was pretty much inevitable. Melissa wants me to come to ohio for four weeks next summer to dance for her!!</br>Good work getting on that rebound train ;)</br></br>2015-07-26 11:22</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>thats cool, do you think you're gonna go?</br></br>2015-07-26 12:09</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I have no idea, it's too soon to tell hat I'm going to want to do next summer. I am interested in pursuing dance for the summer though, but I still do't know.</br></br>2015-07-28 08:36</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I'm going to be back August 2nd and leaving on the 3rd</br>Also I'm in canada!</br></br>2015-07-28 12:05</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>What day is your audition? and how's Canada?</br></br>2015-07-28 08:21</br>Rosemary Adams</br>The 2nd, and awesome</br></br>2015-07-31 05:48</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>https://www.facebook.com/officialkaleo/photos/a.151075448418898.1073741827.151071368419306/396907307169043/?type=1&theater</br></br>2015-07-31 05:48</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>omg</br></br>2015-08-02 02:16</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I'm 45 minutes away from hom</br>e</br>#sotired #ilovebed #cantwaittoseeyou</br>#ismelllikesulfur</br></br>2015-08-03 11:33</br>Rosemary Adams</br></br>2015-08-08 01:48</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Rosey so I decided to see what OkCupid (the dating site) was like tonight and oh man its been interesting</br>i LITERALLY cannot handle the number of messages I</br>Im getting. With Tinder I could discriminate, I've gotten way weirder stuff from here already and its been like an hour</br></br>2015-08-10 04:00</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Holy crap, anyone interesting?</br>also, do you wanna do the Dogs move in crew thing? They need like 80 more people, specifically in West Campus and I wanna sign up</br></br>2015-08-10 06:52</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I actually already signed up haha so yeah you should do it too if you want</br>and yeah some guy really wanted to be my "daddy" that was interesting, but there's all sorts of people. And I'm going on dates with two of them</br></br>2015-08-12 03:53</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Hollly shit I  just had a 3 hour conversation with a dude on omegle about how he was sexually assaulted as a child and now can only get off to porn of women literally getting murdered and how he's not comfortable touching his gf of 8 months. I think we made some good progress but it was literally probably the strangest convoy of my entire life and I had to tell someone about it</br></br>2015-08-12 04:05</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>He murdered a cat! </br>And his best friend is a neo-Nazi he met on 4chan</br></br>2015-08-12 06:25</br>Rosemary Adams</br></br>2015-08-12 06:31</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Some asian girl asked him out and he essentially called her a "slutty chink"</br>and he gave another girl a gatorade with 30 caffeine pills in it, and then she went to the hospital and even though she confronted him he never admitted to her that he did it</br>and he refused to even tell her what he gave her, so I just imagine her thinking she was given meth or something</br>Honestly on top of all this I'm not sure if he's actually a bad person... he wanted advice on whether or not he should apologize, I think he's just kind of fucked up</br></br>2015-08-12 07:16</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Being a fucked up person is kind of a shitty excuse for being shitty to your fellow human beings for no.reason</br>But anyways</br>I got into that company!!!</br>They rehearse in freemont by U House so I'll be back there on the weekends</br>And they originally had me in two pieces but I only wanted to do one, so thats like a 2-3 hour commitment once a week until the show in April</br>They want me to be a featured dancer in a new work! </br></br>2015-08-12 07:25</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Also I mailed you a couple letters because I was sad and our wifi was down for the fourth week in a row. </br>Matt and I went kayaking out on lake Ozette yesterday and camped out on the shore and had sex in the sand and it was nice but I was so tired that I went to sleep at 7. He lured me out at 9 with a smore.</br></br>2015-08-13 09:01</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Cool, congrats! That'll be fun.</br>I went on a date with a 26 year old guy today, it was actually surprisingly nice and we're gonna go out again, but I have another date tomorrow with someone else so we'll see</br></br>2015-08-15 02:22</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I got your letters! My parents have been gone since tuesday (its satuday) so it's been pretty slow around here, the house has been very empty. Me and Keegan haven't hung out, we're not really friends. Which I don't mind honestly, except that he made such a point of repeatedly during our relationship saying that he wanted to stay friends and that it was important to him that we be friends (which was always hurtful to hear, because he was just preparing for our breakup) and now that we're actually broken up he made literally no effort to hang out with me once, which is how I assumed it would be he's just such a hypocrite that just wanted to be able to pat himself on the back for being a considerate person regardless of if that involves actually being considerate</br></br>2015-08-15 02:24</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>But honestly I don't care, we still play wow once-a week ish, and we talk occasionally.They launched their alpha version of Tack and I looked at their website and it's actually really good, I never really understood what it was before but I actually think it's really good, and very professionally put together. So I messaged him about that and we chatted for a bit</br></br>2015-08-15 02:26</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I've been doing a lot of chatting with guys online, which has kind of become most of socialization, especially since my parents left. But that's been fun. I got messages from 27 different people yesterday.</br></br>2015-08-16 02:32</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I also watched 15 episodes of parks and rec today so I've got that going for me. But hey I also started and finished my critter homework which was surprisingly easy? It took like 2 hours and most of that was on my husky, which is dope</br></br>2015-08-16 02:40</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Careful with critters, it's just really hard to debug. Hippo was the hardest one for me to figure out, but if you get while loops then yeah, it should be easy. </br>27? Dang girl. I will definitely have to creep your profile. </br>;)</br></br>2015-08-16 03:41</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Oh man I was tidying up my room and re-read my Europe diary and there's some classics in there, "So this is what it is to be a slut"  good times</br></br>2015-08-16 11:04</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Okay so real talk I'm kind of thinking of rushing a sorority</br></br>2015-08-16 11:44</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>They do so many fun events!</br>But I also want to talk to you about this first, but I have to decide before sept. 1</br></br>2015-08-18 12:50</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I'm pretty set on this idea now, but you should definitely call me when you get a chance</br></br>2015-08-18 12:53</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I'll call you tomorrow, we just got into town</br>Why do you want to rush? </br></br>2015-08-18 01:00</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Hey! Mainly cause I think it's be fun, and I feel like last year while it was nice I didn't really meet a lot of new people and I think it's be cool to have an actual group of people to hang out with</br></br>2015-08-18 01:33</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Would you live out?</br></br>2015-08-18 01:37</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>No, none of the sororities let people live out their first year. I probably would next year though</br></br>2015-08-19 09:35</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I'm back in the boonies, so no more texting</br></br>2015-08-19 09:36</br>Rosemary Adams</br></br>2015-08-21 11:29</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Hey! I smoked weed alone for the first time tonight to celebrate the end of finals and man my tolerance is lowwww</br>I think at this point smoking weed will always kind of remind me of you </br>Also I just want to say that while I'm really excited to join a sorority and have that phase of my life our friendship will always be important to me, and it's okay if it changes shape for a little while. I think we're good enough to survive it</br></br>2015-08-21 11:38</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br></br>2015-08-21 11:38</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br></br>2015-08-22 10:00</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Awwww thank you for that zoe, you mean a lot to me too ❤</br></br>2015-08-22 10:01</br>Rosemary Adams</br></br>2015-08-22 10:01</br>Rosemary Adams</br></br>2015-08-22 10:02</br>Rosemary Adams</br>How much hiking do you want to do while you are out here? Eight mile minimum or twenty mile maximum</br></br>2015-08-22 12:57</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Oh god that's so much hiking</br></br>2015-08-22 01:03</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Uhh 10? I'm pretty out of shape lol</br></br>2015-08-22 04:08</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Idk man, the twenty mile loop is totally worth it. If we leave 8 am then we can do it semi-leisurely, take breaks, make lunch, ect.</br>Would you wanna camp?</br>Also if there is any way for you to get hard a then you should definitely bring some up</br></br>2015-08-22 04:19</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Haha 20 miles in one day or over 2? I'd be down to camp but I'd have to bring some supplies then</br></br>2015-08-22 04:19</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Exactly, that's why I'm trying to plan ahead :)</br></br>2015-08-22 04:19</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>And I would if I could but I don't think I can bring any allcohol haha</br></br>2015-08-22 04:20</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Twenty miles in one day. I did it in two and it's honestly harder because you have to carry stuff.</br>But we could hike six miles out to a beach and camp there</br>Point is theres a lot of options</br></br>2015-08-22 04:21</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Also guess who got a 93% on their cs final!! (Me) I legit teared up a little bit because I was pretty stressed out about that one, so I studied a *lot*</br></br>2015-08-22 04:21</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Ugh</br>What was your gpa?</br></br>2015-08-22 04:21</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Ooh I like 6 mile bike idea</br>And idk yet, we only took the final yesterday and they haven't graded out last homeowkr yet haha so I was surprised to hear back by today</br></br>2015-08-22 04:22</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Dang. Well, I'll let you know how jealous I am once we know about that ;)</br>I gtg to work, we'll plan some more later</br></br>2015-08-22 04:23</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>It probably won't be that high, I didn't do nearly as well on my midterm but we'll see</br></br>2015-08-22 09:20</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Okay so if you want to camp you have to bring a tent</br></br>2015-08-22 10:09</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>That makes sense, my family has a few tents I could bring</br></br>2015-08-22 10:39</br>Rosemary Adams</br>However, I don't really want to camp. It gets really cold at night out here (low forties) and matt and I just don't have the supplies. </br>I really think that the best use of our time would be to embark on an all day hike (20 miles). We leave at 8 and then that evening we chill at sol duc and then the next day we drive out to Rialto beach</br>We need to decide what we are doing tonight though, because our coworker is going into town and I'm gonna have him pick some things up</br>The hike is sooooo coooool zoe you won't regret it</br></br>2015-08-22 10:45</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Sure I'm fine with that, although 20 miles is a bit intimidating</br></br>2015-08-22 10:47</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I know, but think of how accomplished you'll feel at the end! Its only half way uphill. You go up up up and then you are on this ridge for a while and you see all.of mt olympus and then its downhill and flat</br>We can always go back, but I guarantee that you won't be tired until halfway and then at that point you might as well go on</br>We do have to leave early in the morning</br>Imma need you to bring apples and chocolate of your choice, matt and I got everything else covered</br>You'll want a backpack as well</br>Oh man I'm pumped</br></br>2015-08-22 10:57</br>Rosemary Adams</br>We can always do something else, I promise, if you change your mind about twenty miles, which I would really understand. I just don't think you'll regret doing the whole thing.</br></br>2015-08-22 11:04</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Zooooooeeeeee tell me your thoughts</br></br>2015-08-22 11:04</br>Rosemary Adams</br></br>2015-08-22 11:05</br>Rosemary Adams</br></br>2015-08-22 11:05</br>Rosemary Adams</br></br>2015-08-22 11:05</br>Rosemary Adams</br></br>2015-08-23 11:20</br>Rosemary Adams</br> Hey.</br>We don't have to do the whole hike</br>We could go into Port Angeles!</br>We have the supplies to do basically anything now, so we'll chat when you get here</br></br>2015-08-23 11:22</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Omg I just got a message from Scottie Cohen saying "Yoooo" what the he'll is happening</br></br>2015-08-23 11:22</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Jesus wot</br></br>2015-08-23 11:22</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>But yeah I responded to your message but apparently it didn't go through so sorry, I'm down to try the hike but yeah we can chat about it tomorrow</br>I did get chocolate, how many apples should I get?</br></br>2015-08-23 11:24</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Sounds good. Bring a swimsuit! Idk man, like 6? Two each for two days is not unreasonable</br></br>2015-08-23 11:24</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Apparently he actually messaged me yesterday but I never saw it, I'm so confused right now</br></br>2015-08-23 11:24</br>Rosemary Adams</br>We got hard a, I.hope you wanna get drunk and go swimming</br></br>2015-08-23 11:25</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>And ok I'll pick em up tomorrow. Sounds fun! I'm gonna head up after work tomorrow so I'll probably leave around 4, should I just walk in? Do I need to check in or something</br></br>2015-08-23 11:26</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Just message me when you get into PA, it's an hour at least from there and I'll be off and waiting for you outside on the porch, just walk up!</br></br>2015-08-23 11:26</br>Rosemary Adams</br></br>2015-08-23 11:27</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Okedoke artichoke</br>I think I'm gonna message Scotty back, because I'm super confused by this</br></br>2015-08-23 11:30</br>Rosemary Adams</br> Kk I'm going to bed. See you tomorrow!!!</br></br>2015-08-23 11:31</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Okay, see you tomorrow! </br></br>2015-08-23 11:38</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Update: he invited me to smoke weed</br></br>2015-08-23 11:57</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Omg rosey wake up I literally can't right now</br></br>2015-08-24 12:25</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Well I'm meeting him at ebrite if I die he killed me</br></br>2015-08-24 02:35</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Well we 69ed in his car</br></br>2015-08-24 05:33</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Alright I had to stay late but I'm leaving now, see you in 4 hours!</br></br>2015-08-24 08:31</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>In port Angeles, right on time</br></br>2015-08-28 10:38</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>heyo, officially registered for recruitment, which means my housing is canceled</br>If you're gonna register it has to be done before the 31st</br>Have you decided what you're gonna do?</br></br>2015-08-30 01:36</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>roseyyyyyyy</br>Today's your last day to cancel housing if you're gonna do it</br></br>2015-08-30 03:48</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Tomorrow, plus it's only an xtra $15 a day.</br>I have a lease on an apartment!</br></br>2015-08-30 03:52</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Oh cool, what's it like? Are you gonna live with Matt?</br></br>2015-08-30 10:02</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Nope</br>!</br>for a couple months at least</br>I'm gonna need help picking out some furniture</br>and decorating</br>It's a block away from ATO</br>so I figure that I can be a safe haven for all my greek family :)</br>Matt already promised to make breakfast for me every time he sleeps over</br>and we can throw parties!</br>Housing at UW has officially been cancelled</br></br>2015-08-30 10:14</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I decided against a sorority for several reasons, mainly because I don't want or need to make a houseful of friends. I have decided to join a club (probably Seed because I can get passionate about sustainability) to have a social life and having my own space to decorate and hang out in my robe in will be crucial to my mental happiness. I will miss you as a roommate, probably more than you will miss me, but I really do value you as a lifelong friend, and we cannot just discount all we have been through just because we aren't living together. <3</br></br>2015-08-30 10:51</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>It's cool you were able to find somewhere so close, that'll be nice. I'm worried you'll be lonely, but I'm sure Matt will sleep over there a fair amount especially since you don't have any roommates so you'll probably be okay</br>also pj's back! we're gonna hang out tomottow</br>Joining a club is a good idea, because you should definitely try to hang out with new people besides just Matt</br></br>2015-08-30 10:55</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I agree. I agree with all your reasons for joining a sorority, but I think that joining a sorority isn't the right solution for me. Just please promise me we will still see each other. This is my primary concern. </br>I'm worried I'll be lonely too, but I think proximity will really help with that. Plus, having nothing to do at home will force me out into the world.</br>Tbh, Matt and I will probably move in together. "I love you, you are the one for me, and I want to be with you forever"- Matt</br>But #independence so I want to be on my own for a little bit</br></br>2015-08-30 11:34</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>We'll still hang out for sure, we can schedule weekly coffee dates or something at the very least.</br></br>2015-08-30 11:39</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>When do you move into the apartment?</br></br>2015-08-31 02:44</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I haven't decided yet. I am paying rent for September, so I can move in whenever.

I will be your guide person and will only mess with you a little bit if you need.</br></br>2015-10-24 02:10</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>No it was from exposure to dangerously high levels of uv rays, lab related injury. It was stupid but kind of a long story. the good news is it's been almost 12 hours and I haven't broken out in burns so i think the exposure was short enough to be okay</br>It was pre-gad, I was kind of freaking out and like considering canceling but I'm glad I went it was fun</br></br>2015-10-24 09:04</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Why weren't you protected from these uv rays?! </br></br>2015-11-07 12:37</br>Rosemary Adams</br>You were right, there is no show tomorrow.

I'm gonna do it regardless of what he thinks.</br></br>2015-11-11 04:30</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Yeah I get that.

I'm glad it's cool, so you think you're going to move in there?</br></br>2016-02-15 09:40</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Well I'm not sure about that, because I'm still kind of holding out on hearing anything back from any sorority but I told her I would get back to her in a week and I think I'm going to go for it at that point</br>It's not like my life will be much different, still have a roommate but also a BEAUTIFUL place to live</br>With spaaace</br>800 a month, including all utilities</br>And I found out that for my current place it's 850 a month with shitty Internet and an electric  bill and no personal kitchen so</br>*for a single, since it's matt and I it's more like 525</br>But I figure then we could actually chill at my place sometimes and watch TV and stuff so that would be nice</br>I have to call my parents and talk about it but it's pretty much my only option right now</br>Then next year I'm going to try and rush and if that doesn't happen the I have no idea</br>Goddammit aephi just got back to me</br>This is going to be a hard choice</br></br>2016-02-15 09:48</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>what did they say?</br>but it sounds like a nice place, and its perfect for spring quarter</br></br>2016-02-15 09:48</br>Rosemary Adams</br>We are going on a coffee date tomorrow, but I'm sure I'm going to learn more about cob and stuff</br>Obviously</br>I know right</br></br>2016-02-15 09:51</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>oh okay, but if they said they're done with winter cob then what does that mean??</br></br>2016-02-15 09:53</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I have no idea! They tried to set it up first then after a couple back and forth scheduling emails they said they were done. So my guess is they have the space to take people on for spring but don't want to have like a million initiations</br></br>2016-02-15 09:56</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>yeah, well good luck! It should be fun</br>did you end up doing anything with matt for valentines day&gt;</br></br>2016-02-15 09:56</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Oh Jesus I'm not looking forward to this decision process, but yeah, I'm excited for some change.</br>We got dumplings with my favorite valentine (dad) and my sisters then just did homework all day.

I live in a sorority... but yeah he just gave off that gay vibe, so I feel like even if we got along which we probably would I just can't imagine hoooking up with him</br>wait what did they say??</br></br>2016-02-15 10:22</br>Rosemary Adams</br>That they don't have any events currently but she would let me know if they got any on the calendar, I'm going to ask if that means they are closed or waiting for spring or what</br>It appears everyone had elections and so the new recruitment chairs are better</br></br>2016-02-15 10:23</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I'm glad they got back to you! DZ is an actually good house, and that's the one Vica is considering COBing because she  has a friend there</br>and yeah that makes sense, most of the old recruitment chairs are probably jsut burnt out</br></br>2016-02-15 10:23</br>Rosemary Adams</br>You live in a sorority but drunkenly go on about proteins,  you are socially forgiven</br>Ooh being sisters with vica would be wild</br>So options! Yay!</br></br>2016-02-15 10:25</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>haha that's cause proteins are cool! but yeah I figure I might as well go out for coffee, I'm not committing to fucking the guy</br></br>2016-02-15 10:25</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Exactly! You can fuck later. Besides, he seems like a good conversationalist.</br></br>2016-02-15 10:25</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>she said she might not actually rush though because right now she just goes out with them and then crashes in their sleeping porch haha so she doesn't really need to</br>in classic vica style</br></br>2016-02-15 10:26</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Holy cow that girl is never going to have to change</br>Life is just going to work like that for her</br>Jeez</br></br>2016-02-15 10:28</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I think it's just actually being willing to for things that other people wouldn't ask for because they don't put people in that position. I think any of us could live like that if we didn't care what other people thought of us haha</br>I just remember her literally inviting herself along on sam xiaos family trip to China</br>so absurd</br>but it worked, because she asked</br>and was also hot</br></br>2016-02-15 10:31</br>Rosemary Adams</br>It's just so wild. </br>It'll be interesting 50 years from now when that no longer works</br></br>2016-02-15 10:42</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>who knows maybe it still will</br>she has a avery persuasive personality</br></br>2016-02-15 10:42</br>Rosemary Adams</br>This is true.

I'm not sure if it's my phone charger that's broken or my phone but either way I can't charge it and it's dead forever. I'm hoping its my charger since it's been acting weird for a few weeks anyway</br>I don't even know where to buy a charger around here. The bookstore?</br></br>2016-04-26 08:26</br>Rosemary Adams</br>The bookstore. I don't have an extra but you can borrow mine, I can charge my phone through my laptop until you figure your ish out</br></br>2016-04-26 08:27</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I have the plug part, just not the cord. I might be able to find someone in the house that has one but everyone I've talked to has iphones</br>In other news are you going out tonight?</br></br>2016-04-26 08:32</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I've actually got an extra cord, it's unideal (aka pretty short) but you can have it. I'm not, I have an 8:30 tomorrow</br></br>2016-04-26 09:25</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I actually found one in my house so I should be okay until I buy a new one. Thanks though!</br></br>2016-04-26 09:26</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Hey no problem.

If you haven't I really suggest you do. Powerful stuff, gave me literal goosebumps.</br></br>2016-06-08 10:09</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Yeah it's basically all I've seen on my facebook wall for like 3 days, but I'm glad its getting talked about</br></br>2016-06-08 10:10</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Same. I'm glad it's getting talked about because its the epitome of classism in the US, and is such a blow to women's rights. I just never realized what they did to you in the hospital after an assault, reading that description was honestly horrifying.</br></br>2016-06-08 10:13</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>YeahI can see why people don't want to go to the hospital, especially right after being assaulted that does not sound fun</br></br>2016-06-08 10:15</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>ALthough okay there's a ton of memes with just the guys picture saying like "brock turner is a rapist" and I think that is taking it too far. Yes he sexually assaulted her and committed a crime but we also have a criminal justice system for this and idk I feel like people are taking it slightly too far</br></br>2016-06-08 10:15</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>although I guess the point is that the criminal justice system failed, but still vigilantism isn't really the solution</br></br>2016-06-08 10:19</br>Rosemary Adams</br>At the same time, he's getting off the hook incredibly easy. 6 months for 3 accounts? I don't think it's going to solve anything, but the fact that he decided to take the risk of going to trial meant that this is public knowledge. I do think that it's a way for people to "care" without doing anything, and that it is going to have a serious impact on his future, but maybe he shouldn't have raped someone and just denied the shit out of it.</br></br>2016-06-08 10:20</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I am always annoyed when the internet hooks onto something so much, though this seems to be mostly a facebook thing but I am okay with it this time.</br></br>2016-06-08 10:26</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I'm glad it started a dialogue about campus rapes, because that is always good and a lot of people still don't really acknowledge it, but i wish it were less targeted</br></br>2016-06-08 10:27</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2016/06/the_stanford_rape_case_and_liberal_hypocrisy.html?wpsrc=sh_all_mob_em_ru</br></br>2016-06-08 10:27</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>This article actually sums up a lot of my feelings on the matter, maybe its just because I've been inundated with it for days</br>But I can see why the case became a national lighting rod because yeah it very clearly lies out the differences for treatment and sentencing for upper-class white people, and the way rape victims are treated. I'm kind of conflicted on everything</br>I much prefer this to the gorilla outrage</br></br>2016-06-08 10:32</br>Rosemary Adams</br>The internet is a fickle place. I like that article, sums up the impact of mob mentality really well, and I didn't realize that people had started a petition to impeach the judge. That seems like too much, certainly its an opportunity to open up dialogue, but mod mentality is never fully right. The meme thing I'm okay with, his 21st century scarlet letter. Which is ironic because I wasn't a fan of what the original scarlet letter stood for, but it seems ironically applicable here.</br></br>2016-06-08 10:32</br>Rosemary Adams</br>lol ironically twice in the same sentence, someone is tired (hint: its me)</br></br>2016-06-08 10:39</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I think it just makes me uncomfortable because of the precedent it sets, even if he deserves it (which he probably does - he was convicted after all) if it starts becoming trendy to post pictures of people and their crimes I feel like it's a slippery slope</br>Either way in a week everyone will stop caring but hopefully the good that will come is that it will deter future guys from trying to hookup with a girl that is blacked out</br>and that's all we can really hope for</br>Either way I have to continue jamming ochem into my head until my brain melts</br>But while I'm procrastinating and sharing articles with you I liked this one on Hillary Clinton</br></br>2016-06-08 10:45</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>http://www.vox.com/2016/6/7/11879728/hillary-clinton-wins-nomination</br></br>2016-06-08 10:46</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Now that I am defaulting to supporting her for rpesident I think it brings up some interesting points on the very real sexist bias in the presidential elections</br></br>2016-06-22 12:52</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Can you get white wine for tonight? We need it for pasta and Kalani can't get it.</br></br>2016-06-22 01:04</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Uh I'm not 21 either, why don't we just use a different recipe?</br></br>2016-06-22 03:10</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I know, but Kalani doesn't have a hookup and I'm at work.

What did he say?</br></br>2016-10-05 11:37</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I think it's just that the more I think about the whole astrid/him thing the more pissed I am about it. I feel like I have given her way more respect and concessions than I had to by any means, and she is abusing that by still being all weird and seeing him and stuff.</br>And I kind of hate him for facilitating that.</br>It's not really thought out, I just feel a little toxic inside.</br>He said stupid shit</br>"i know youre a spotify elitist but I think you'll like this song"</br>then a link to the song</br>then a couple hours late a screenshot of his purchased page for Devin Townsend tickets</br></br>2016-10-05 11:39</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>"spotify elitist" what does that even mean</br></br>2016-10-05 11:40</br>Rosemary Adams</br>It means I don't like garage band</br></br>2016-10-05 11:40</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>is that the same concert youre going to?</br></br>2016-10-05 11:40</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I might be going to that one, I have a show that same night so I'm going to reevaluate last minute, but he is going to the one I am.</br></br>2016-10-05 11:40</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>That does seem like random stuff to bring up, especially after everything else</br></br>2016-10-05 11:40</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I'm a big fan though, and he knows that</br>Seriously</br>It's like oh let me forget everything and make pleasant convo with you</br>???</br>Also I saw him walking to campus and I completely ignored him</br>He waved and everything</br>But I just kept going</br>This was before the texts</br></br>2016-10-05 11:43</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>aww :( maybe that's why he wanted to reach out</br></br>2016-10-05 11:44</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I don't feel sorry at all. he burned that bridge and now he has to deal with the consequences.</br>And really he wins out, he's got a girlfriend already</br>I just need to let it go</br>But I'm so salty</br></br>2016-10-05 11:53</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Yeah that's fair, I think what would be best is if you could just not talk to either of them but living with astrid makes that difficult</br></br>2016-10-05 11:56</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I want to be angry at him so badly. I want to yell at him.

desire</br></br>2016-11-07 09:23</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Part of me just wants to plan my own and not try to do a joint one because then it'd be easier but also I don't want to just cut her our, but we're not actually that close</br></br>2016-11-07 09:23</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Don't cut her out</br>Just stop including her</br>It's different</br>?</br>Are you setting up an event page about it?</br></br>2016-11-07 09:24</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Yeah, I need to ask someone to do it though because it's traditionally done by a friend</br></br>2016-11-07 09:24</br>Rosemary Adams</br>where on earth could you find one of those</br></br>2016-11-07 09:24</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I'd ask you but in the least offensive way of saying this you're not friends with most of the people I need to invite so it'd be easier to ask someone in the sorority</br></br>2016-11-07 09:24</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Nah that makes sense</br>I'm planning friendsgiving for you</br></br>2016-11-07 09:24</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>plus you don't know Sydney at al and I don't want the page to be all about me</br></br>2016-11-07 09:24</br>Rosemary Adams</br>so its fine</br></br>2016-11-07 09:24</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>wooo</br></br>2016-11-07 09:25</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Lol I am going to give a speech about how great you are</br>just you wait</br></br>2016-11-07 09:25</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>BUT most of the people I would ask in the house also don't know Sydney and they feel weird just talking about me so idk what to do</br>haha oh god..</br>we don't need speeches I think it should be more thanksgiving themed than birthday themed</br></br>2016-11-07 09:26</br>Rosemary Adams</br>but I looooovveee youuuuuuu</br>drunk me certainly can't be stopped</br></br>2016-11-07 09:26</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>hahaha okay</br></br>2016-11-07 09:26</br>Rosemary Adams</br>okay so who are the potential event setter-uppers</br>pick one that doesn't know sydney?</br>play it off as an innocent mistake</br></br>2016-11-07 09:26</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I am not going to really be able to drink at all though because my birthday is immediately followed by a phjysics then biochem exam</br>Haha probably Allie, Hannah or Emma</br>Emma is the best choice for mutual friendship but not the best event-planner wise, plus she has the flu</br></br>2016-11-07 09:27</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Hmmm</br>I was going to suggest Emma but her planning skills are bad</br></br>2016-11-07 09:27</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>UGH SHE JUST RESPONDED AND WANTS TO MOVE THE DAY IM QUITTING</br></br>2016-11-07 09:28</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Allie?</br>lolololololo</br>Hold on I'll brb</br></br>2016-11-07 09:28</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>she doesn't want to do it at KA because she doesn't know them very well but ugh I already talked to everyone</br></br>2016-11-07 09:30</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Tell her that!!</br></br>2016-11-07 09:30</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>It's okay we're on NBNB the day she suggested so I have a good ecuse</br></br>2016-11-07 09:30</br>Rosemary Adams</br>You can politely and diplomatically say that if you two want to do different days then you don't have to do it on the same one</br>ya feel</br>why nbnb?</br></br>2016-11-07 09:32</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>we have initiation that sunday, and we're on nbnb 24 hrs before</br></br>2016-11-07 09:32</br>Rosemary Adams</br>ooohh</br></br>2016-11-07 09:32</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>so the friday is the only day</br>I told her she can reschedule at ZBT if she wants but I"m gonna stick with KA</br></br>2016-11-07 09:33</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Good for you</br>Stick to them guns</br>Plus you already planned it so</br></br>2016-11-07 09:33</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I mean I haven't planned that much but it still required mental labor</br>plus it would mean doing it another weekend and I don't want to do it that late</br></br>2016-11-07 09:34</br>Rosemary Adams</br>yeah this was never meant to be</br>What day are you planning for?</br></br>2016-11-07 09:35</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>friday the 18th</br></br>2016-11-07 09:36</br>Rosemary Adams</br></br>2016-11-07 09:36</br>Rosemary Adams</br>hows the boy</br>GOD

gotta text him</br></br>2016-11-07 09:37</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I thought the advice was not to text him and let him reach out to me?</br>because I've been coming on a little strong</br></br>2016-11-07 09:38</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Life is fickle such is my advice</br></br>2016-11-07 09:38</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>hahaha true</br></br>2016-11-07 09:38</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Okay the options are</br>1. Text him</br>and probably have a good outcome cause he's  busy as hell and it feels good to be wanted</br>2. Dont</br>lose him to the void</br></br>2016-11-07 09:38</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>also i literally could not hang out with him for at least a week so I don't know what the end game would even be</br></br>2016-11-07 09:38</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Chit chat</br>But that is pretty dumn</br>lol</br>Idk</br>Maintain conversation</br></br>2016-11-07 09:39</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>lol I guess I don't want to lose him to the void</br>but I also don't want to come on too strong</br>And I have kind of always texted him first?</br></br>2016-11-07 09:40</br>Rosemary Adams</br>yeah see that's the part that worries me</br></br>2016-11-07 09:40</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>yeah</br></br>2016-11-07 09:40</br>Rosemary Adams</br>but also he sounds pretty great and that you texting him first wouldn't

Depending on what other people are not</br></br>2016-11-17 12:43</br>Rosemary Adams</br>pumpkin pie</br>from a pumpkin</br></br>2016-11-17 01:31</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Oh yeah that too</br>We need to leave some for other people though lol</br></br>2016-11-17 01:32</br>Rosemary Adams</br>It takes like 3 hours</br>Just warning you</br>We could do potatoes and pie</br>But someone else could bring potatoes and we could do yapples or something</br></br>2016-11-17 01:35</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Maybe we should just claim pie, see what other people want to do, and then do whatever is left</br></br>2016-11-17 01:36</br>Rosemary Adams</br>But I feel like since there's two of us we should make two things?</br></br>2016-11-17 01:36</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I know i just think we could do a lot of things so we can let other people pick what they want and fill in the Thanksgiving holes</br></br>2016-11-17 01:36</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Ahhhhh</br>okay</br>I'll post it</br></br>2016-11-18 11:30</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Have you heard from anyone else that's coming?</br></br>2016-11-18 11:40</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Kalani made a spreadsheet</br>We are on pie and potatoes and we have rhe oven from 1 to 4</br></br>2016-11-18 11:44</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Hahaha I'm glad we planned oven time</br>How are we cooking the turkey?</br>Also, yapples?</br>Also how many people are actually coming because there's only like 5 on fb so we might have way too much food</br></br>2016-11-18 11:48</br>Rosemary Adams</br>We are definitely going to have too much food.

I'm reaching the point where the things that killed my grandparents are easily survivable because of what you guys are doing</br></br>2016-12-07 02:52</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Aww</br></br>2016-12-07 02:52</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>"I'm so grateful for you and want you to know that I value all of the hard work you're doing.

I have no doubt about. You will change the world for the better. I just get these gut feelings about people, and I know you are a good person"</br></br>2016-12-07 02:53</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>and then she told me not to give up and that I seem great for a while and I had to go to class</br></br>2016-12-07 02:53</br>Rosemary Adams</br>WOW</br></br>2016-12-07 02:54</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>and honestly I've been feeling pretty burned ot and disillusioned about whether or not this is the right path for me because my classes are wearing me down and honestly it was a great pep talk</br>great reminder of why we're here</br>and part of what she said is "I think sometimes we're meant to meet people. I think I was meant to meet you here because you reminded me of hope for the future while I"m worried about my husband"</br>and honestly that stuff is usually too mystical for me but I kind of agree with what she was saying because her ridiculously kind pep talk was kind of just what I needed today and at this juncture in my life</br></br>2016-12-07 02:56</br>Rosemary Adams</br>oh my gosh</br>that woman sounds like an angel</br></br>2016-12-07 02:57</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>like literally part of me thought that she wasn't even there and it was a hallucination</br>like who does that</br></br>2016-12-07 02:57</br>Rosemary Adams</br>People who have brain surgery?</br>And have a better perspective on life than us plebs</br></br>2016-12-07 02:57</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>true</br></br>2016-12-07 02:58</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Goals is to channel that energy now</br></br>2016-12-07 02:58</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>yeah really</br>tell some strangers they have great auras and they'll do great things. It's pretty motivating</br></br>2016-12-07 02:58</br>Rosemary Adams</br>That is a fantastic thing to do</br>No reason not to</br></br>2016-12-07 02:59</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Yeah I was late to my next class but I think it was worth it</br></br>2016-12-07 02:59</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Definitely</br><3</br></br>2016-12-07 03:00</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>yeah so I just needed to share about that because it kind of blew my mind</br></br>2016-12-07 03:01</br>Rosemary Adams</br>It's a beautiful story and I feel better for having heard it</br>And you deserve it</br>You are great</br></br>2016-12-07 03:03</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>haha thank you <3</br>You're great too.

More dancing!</br>I liked the last one but it was a bit out there</br></br>2017-01-19 10:02</br>Rosemary Adams</br>the last one was way too from the sixties</br>this one is fresh and delicious</br>and so enthralling</br>I dreamed about it</br>#hyped</br></br>2017-01-25 09:35</br>Rosemary Adams</br></br>2017-01-25 09:35</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>damn too true</br>I almost want to send that to him</br></br>2017-01-25 09:38</br>Rosemary Adams</br>omg do it</br>"so how are you two doing" "we send each other memes now" "OHHHH"</br></br>2017-01-25 09:38</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>meme of memes</br>I'll save it for tomorrow or something we just talked and I dont want to send him this randomly an hour later</br>he might use them with everyone though idk his habits</br></br>2017-01-25 09:39</br>Rosemary Adams</br>doesn't matter</br>still funny</br>how are you two doing?</br></br>2017-01-25 09:39</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>true</br>well</br>we're gonna hang out on friday, which will be the first time since the formal</br>but today I asked him on our GAD which is next friday</br>and he was like "fuck I can't go I already told an AXO that I would go to her gad that night"</br>so I was like wtf</br>okay</br>but then he was like "I'd rather go to yours though"</br>and then we found out that both our house and AXO are having GADs ar gameworks the same night which is ridiculous</br>so I was like "I'm gonna be honest it would feel weird both being there with different people"</br>and he was like "I agree I'm gonna talk to her"</br>and now we're going together!</br></br>2017-01-25 09:42</br>Rosemary Adams</br>yay!</br>aw</br>cute</br>so are you going to go on that zbt formal?</br></br>2017-01-25 09:43</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>yeah im kinda mad he was going to go on a gad with someone else in the first place but at least he was willing to bail on her for me so</br>idk about that</br>since clearly hes going on gads with other people idk why i should not</br>I might ask him depending on the vibe</br></br>2017-01-25 09:43</br>Rosemary Adams</br>okay hold up</br>you were going to do the same thing to him though</br></br>2017-01-25 09:44</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I was gonna talk to him about it though</br></br>2017-01-25 09:44</br>Rosemary Adams</br>so I understand the annoyance but cmon now</br></br>2017-01-25 09:44</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>and also felt weird about it</br>which he clearly didn't</br>which makes sense since we're not exclusive</br>I also found out that he's afraid of getting hurt again because his last/only girlfriend dumped him and broke his heart</br>I didn't hear that from him though</br>which is unfortunate because that makes me nervous that he still has feelings for her</br></br>2017-01-25 09:45</br>Rosemary Adams</br>easy fix</br>don't break his heart</br>although you're pretty special so I could see that being difficult</br>;)</br></br>2017-01-25 09:45</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>ugh</br></br>2017-01-25 09:45</br>Rosemary Adams</br>and you keep saying you aren't exclusive</br></br>2017-01-25 09:46</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>we aren't</br></br>2017-01-25 09:46</br>Rosemary Adams</br>but I think you two are seeing each other exclusively</br>so</br></br>2017-01-25 09:46</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>clearly hes going on gads with other people</br>at least planned on going to a gad</br>but yeah I do think neither of us are seeing anyone else</br></br>2017-01-25 09:48</br>Rosemary Adams</br>so</br></br>2017-01-25 09:49</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>so</br></br>2017-01-25 09:49</br>Rosemary Adams</br>this is an unpopular opinion</br>but you two should probably talk</br>possibly sober even</br>over sushi maybe</br></br>2017-01-25 09:50</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>That opinion is more popular than you might think</br>we're getting sushi on friday lmao</br>cant stop wont stop</br>but after last time I'm resistant to bringing it up again</br></br>2017-01-25 09:51</br>Rosemary Adams</br>oh yay!</br>fair fair</br>things that are awkward and terrible are not fun</br></br>2017-01-25 09:51</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>yeah</br></br>2017-01-25 09:51</br>Rosemary Adams</br>but I really think you'll be much happier afterwards</br></br>2017-01-25 09:52</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I mean him immediately bailing on that girl gives me more confidence, I really wonder what he said to her that wasn't extremely awkward</br>maybe, but also I've reached a point where I'm not immediately afraid that he'll ghost on me at any moment which is all I ever wanted to idk if we even need it</br></br>2017-01-25 09:53</br>Rosemary Adams</br>there's also moments where not only are you not worried about him ghosting but you can also send him stuff about doing things to his penis in the middle of the day and lets be real that's part of the fun</br>I also wonder what he said</br>ESPECIALLY since he'll see her while with you lmao</br></br>2017-01-25 09:54</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>lol we dont really sext</br></br>2017-01-25 09:54</br>Rosemary Adams</br>its so fun though</br>doesn't have to be sexy</br>just matter o fact</br>still hot</br></br>2017-01-25 09:55</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>hahahah</br>I could give it a try</br>not really my usual style though</br></br>2017-01-25 09:56</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I feel we differ wildly in sexual preferences and expression yes, but worth a shot I think</br></br>2017-01-25 09:56</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>who knows</br>i started taking birth control again</br>I thought it was time</br>and then I immediately broke out again and remembered wgy I stopped taking it</br></br>2017-01-25 09:56</br>Rosemary Adams</br></br>2017-01-25 09:57</br>Rosemary Adams</br>thats a bummer</br>but pro: no babies</br>especially now that abortion is basically illegal</br></br>2017-01-25 09:57</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>yeah

though because like 10 minutes later was when he had his huge orgasm collapse and I don't think that would've happened if he had jut also came so I'm not very concerned</br>he was honestly much more concerned than me</br></br>2017-02-08 02:21</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Aww</br>That's sweet</br></br>2017-02-08 02:22</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>that's what I said</br>he's great</br>I'm just gonna reiterate that</br>We're bad for each others GPAs rn though</br></br>2017-02-08 02:25</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Yeah that happens</br>I think the emotional health is worth it</br></br>2017-02-08 02:25</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I agree</br>but I feel bad because he has double midterms this week and I keep distracting him</br>Also if you want to come to the date auction its at 7:30</br>you can lie and tell them you're an SK so that we get your participation point</br>AND carson said his act is actually going to be a poem but with like live mad libs? idk hopefully itll be funny</br></br>2017-02-08 02:32</br>Rosemary Adams</br>We'll see how far I am on my work, I have a paper to write and a quiz to study for/take so I don't think I'll have time</br>and that sounds...weird</br>maybe funny</br>maybe you should hope it's kind of bad so he doesn't get bid on? lol</br></br>2017-02-08 02:33</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>hahah he said he'd try to make it mediocre to lessen the competition for me</br>which I appreciated</br></br>2017-02-08 02:33</br>Rosemary Adams</br>awwww</br>I'm melting</br></br>2017-02-08 02:33</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I'll videotape it for posterity</br>I know he's

chocolate afterwards</br></br>2017-02-08 02:35</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>so romantic</br>sounds nice though</br>I think we'll probably just hang out normally, probably get high and watch west world</br></br>2017-02-08 02:35</br>Rosemary Adams</br>solid solid</br></br>2017-02-08 02:35</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>this will be my first not single valentines day</br>idk what to

pitched in $70 to my carson buying fund it's so sweet</br>so if I throw 50 we're very competitive</br></br>2017-02-08 02:36</br>Rosemary Adams</br>throw 50 right away</br>squash the competition</br>cause now you have hella wiggle room</br></br>2017-02-08 02:37</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>realistically we'll probably need the whole 120</br>I was talking to people and $100 is about the minimum</br></br>2017-02-08 02:37</br>Rosemary Adams</br>oh shit!</br>wow</br></br>2017-02-08 02:37</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>to be fair an aquarium for two plus nice dinner will cost more than 100

then be there in the evening, stay, have all day on the 19th (a sunday) then come back up monday?</br>Or we could stay for three days and come back up tuesday</br>so we could have a weekday to do

Ah congrats! That's exciting</br>If you got both which one would you do?</br></br>2017-02-14 04:55</br>Rosemary Adams</br>IDK man</br>I might need your help with a pro con list</br>because liberty wants me to do developer work, and premera wants me to PM</br>so this has a high chance of impacting my career path for my life</br>I can always go from dev to pm but idk if that's a necessary step</br></br>2017-02-14 04:59</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>What is pm</br></br>2017-02-14 04:59</br>Rosemary Adams</br>project manager</br></br>2017-02-14 05:04</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Would that be more fun?</br></br>2017-02-14 05:05</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Well</br></br>2017-02-14 05:05</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>But also might be kind of weird for you to work with carson so we can throw that in for thought</br></br>2017-02-14 05:06</br>Rosemary Adams</br>It's not really about that I guess, it's about obtaining skills that I can use on my career path, and I want to PM eventually, and I'm not sure if I want to go through junior dev, senior dev, and then manager to get there</br>BUT</br>PM's with dev skills are generally more well respected and I am genuinely interested in expanding those skills</br>working with carson wont be weird and besides that doesn't matter in the long run</br>we could carpool lol</br>are you going to try to live in at delts this summer?</br>oh man too early too early</br>don't think abou tit</br></br>2017-02-14 05:15</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I'd feel weird about it but that shouldn't be your most important decision priority</br>Do whatever will build your skills!</br>Might be good to get the building blocks before going to management so you can understand the tasks more</br></br>2017-02-14 05:17</br>Rosemary Adams</br>exactly my thoughts</br>but on the other hand, PMing is its own whole class of skills</br>understanding the technical side is only a part of it, and right now I can do that without needing to dev</br></br>2017-02-14 05:33</br>Rosemary Adams</br>They redeemed themselves</br></br>2017-02-14 05:48</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Also I tried to register for info 201 and I can't get in because I have senior standing 😥 I emailed them but they haven't responded so I'm gonna have to register for something else</br></br>2017-02-14 05:48</br>Rosemary Adams</br>NOOOOOO</br>NO</br>curse you UW</br>UUUGGGHHHH</br>freak</br>ugh</br>WHAT AM I GONNA TENDUE WITHOUT YOU</br></br>2017-02-14 05:50</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I know i wanted to take it you schedule next quarter is really shitty honestly the quiz sections I needed all filled up so I'm all spread out and I don't know how I'm gonna go to work aghhh</br></br>2017-02-14 05:51</br>Rosemary Adams</br>ahhhh</br>morning work?</br>is that possible</br></br>2017-02-14 05:51</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Not really</br>Because I have class at 11:30</br></br>2017-02-14 05:52</br>Rosemary Adams</br>that is a major bummer</br>11:30 is kind of late in the day too ew</br></br>2017-02-14 05:54</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I'm stressed</br>And I made the mistake of sitting next to valasky in physics so now I'm more stressed ah</br>We have an exam and I needed to actually review but that is just a literal impossibility</br></br>2017-02-14 05:57</br>Rosemary Adams</br>is she just following you around or are you in class rn?</br>and I think its time to politely explain that you have president stuff to do and go up to your room for some alone time</br></br>2017-02-14 05:59</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>No we were in class, we have a tutorial section until 6, she just maintains a continuous dialogue the entire time it's honestly impressive but also extremely frustrating</br>But then if I don't sit with her I get guilt tripped</br></br>2017-02-14 06:00</br>Rosemary Adams</br>can...can you put in earbuds?</br>just like</br>do it</br>or alternatively if she's going to talk just stop listening</br></br>2017-02-14 06:00</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Naw cause it's a class</br>My strategy is just to kind of ignore her but that doesn't really work</br></br>2017-02-14 06:01</br>Rosemary Adams</br>god she is oblivious isn't she</br></br>2017-02-14 06:01</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Yeah</br></br>2017-02-14 06:01</br>Rosemary Adams</br>:(</br></br>2017-02-14 06:01</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>She's very sweet, but really doesn't know when to stop talking</br>As in ever.

out?</br></br>2017-02-17 12:38</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Don't have time, got a speech to write, meeting to go to, and a GAD</br></br>2017-02-17 12:39</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>See who's stopping us from

And what's Matt doing? Take PJ</br></br>2017-02-17 12:44</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Trampoline place in ballard, matt is not invited, and somehow I don't think PJ would like going on a trampoline lol</br>I think it's a little early to be bringing him to sorority stuff</br>PLUS I'm mad at him rn</br></br>2017-02-17 12:45</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Oh yeah true might be tense. Why are you mad at him?</br></br>2017-02-17 12:46</br>Rosemary Adams</br>He just attacks me and shuts down the conversation whenever he disagrees with or doesn't understand what I'm talking about</br>ex</br>I was trying to give him my speech this morning and I got to a part talking about "brogrammers and underrepresented minorities"</br>which I will admit I was not super sold on keeping in in the first place</br>but he just freaks out about how I can't just villanize white guys</br>and I'm like</br>but all of tech is that</br>and I'm not villanizing them by saying there's a power dynamic</br>I'm just saying we have to recognize it</br>and then he makes me pull up a bunch of stats and stuff and doesn't believe me when I say that that is the reality of the tech sphere</br>and so I stop reading my speech to him because that is not constructive nor helpful</br>and so finally he's like oh I didn't understand that women were included in underrepresented minorities</br>thanks for explaining what diversity is to me</br>?????</br>wat</br>so I'm annoyed</br></br>2017-02-17 01:00</br>Rosemary Adams</br>do you have a second to read my speech?</br></br>2017-02-17 01:19</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Ugh that's annoying. And seems kind of obvious? That guys dominate the tech sphere but okay</br>But yeah I could read your speech!</br>This is for your election?</br></br>2017-02-17 01:31</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Also Carson finally responded and he was actually upset about what happened, apparently he waited outside of zbt for me for like 45 min and I just didn't respond I feel so bad</br></br>2017-02-17 01:40</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I'm on my way to give my speech, so its past editing but thank you anyways.</br></br>2017-02-17 01:42</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Oh okay, good luck!! I'm sure you'll kill it</br></br>2017-02-17 01:43</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I'm glad he responded! It is reasonable of him to be upset, but these things happen</br>All you can do now is apologize</br></br>2017-02-17 03:00</br>Rosemary Adams</br>hey guess what I got the position! :D</br></br>2017-02-17 03:00</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Yay!!! Congrats!!!!!</br>You're all about the leadership positions rn</br>Did anyone run against you?</br></br>2017-02-17 03:01</br>Rosemary Adams</br>lol nope</br>I'm so happy!</br></br>2017-02-17 03:01</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Haha you intimidated them all away</br></br>2017-02-17 03:01</br>Rosemary Adams</br>(I think so)</br>it was basically a popularity contest</br></br>2017-02-17 03:02</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Elections usually are</br></br>2017-02-17 03:05</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I'm so hyped though, I love IUGA</br>and now I can yell about intersectional feminism!</br>not that I didn't before</br>but now we can do stuff with it!</br></br>2017-02-17 05:15</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Hey!!</br>What are you doing tomorrow?</br>I have to pick out an outfit for myself at Red LIght for the EBEB fashion show and I'm bad at making decisions by myself</br></br>2017-02-17 05:33</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Sorry me and carson are supposed to go to the aquarium tomorrow</br></br>2017-02-17 05:40</br>Rosemary Adams</br>okay, sunday?</br></br>2017-02-18 01:27</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Hey</br>I don't know if you have any formal training on this as a president</br></br>2017-02-18 01:28</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I'm concerned</br>Probably not though honestly I wasn't trained for anything</br></br>2017-02-18 01:29</br>Rosemary Adams</br>but I just had a very long conversation about how one of my sisters wants to kill herself and I confiscated a razor from her and we talked for about an hour and a half until she seemed to be calm and I made sure she got into PJ's and brushed her teeth and got into bed but I don't know where to go from here</br></br>2017-02-18 01:29</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I should mention she came home drunk and sobbing</br></br>2017-02-18 01:30</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Shit that's intense</br></br>2017-02-18 01:30</br>Rosemary Adams</br>yes</br>And she's done this before, last year I know our advisors and house mom got involved</br></br>2017-02-18 01:31</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I'd keep an eye on her tonight and then definitely talk to her about it in the morning when she's sober</br></br>2017-02-18 01:32</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I told her I would call 911 if she was serious and she freaked out</br></br>2017-02-18 01:32</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Yeah that was the right call</br>I don't know what to do either it seems like you did your best</br></br>2017-02-18 01:32</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I hope so</br>I just don't know what next steps are</br>Options include telling Kristen, or our house mom, or her parents</br></br>2017-02-18 01:33</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I'd talk to Kristen about it but let her tell her parents on her own</br></br>2017-02-18 01:34</br>Rosemary Adams</br>She said last time it was either go get counseling, or get her parents involved and she seemed terrified of that</br></br>2017-02-18 01:34</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Counseling is definitely a good call</br>Is she in counseling now?</br></br>2017-02-18 01:34</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I'm thinking she really needs to stop drinking but I'm not sure how to do that without writing her to standards and that seems wildly inappropriate</br>NO</br>Sorry</br>No, she is adamantly against getting help</br>Is trying to push everyone away, is convinced she will hurt people, wants to end it now to save people the pain, ect.</br></br>2017-02-18 01:37</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Hm that makes it difficult to help, Carson says you shoudld keep an eye on her tonight and then talk to her about it directly when she's sober and be able to comfort her then and talk it out again, even though she's not going to want to</br>I also wouldn't send her to standards because that seems like you're punishing her which isn't what you want to do</br></br>2017-02-18 01:39</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Yeah I am going to go check on her in about an hour</br>She definitely won't want to talk about it, but you're right. Addressing this sober is a good idea.</br>She's totally convinced there is nothing worth staying on this planet for and I don't know how to explain to her that part of feeling better is working through it</br>She's scarily methodical too</br>And I know you won't spread this around, but make sure Carson doesn't either please</br></br>2017-02-18 01:45</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Yeah of course, sorry I can't be more helpful</br></br>2017-02-18 01:46</br>Rosemary Adams</br>It's good, I just kind of needed to talk about it with someone not in the house</br></br>2017-02-18 01:46</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Yeah totally get that, it's intense but it sounds like you did the best you could</br></br>2017-02-18 01:47</br>Rosemary Adams</br>It definitely ranks among the more intense experiences of my life.</br>I'm petrified that she might actually do it</br>but I think we're good for tonight</br></br>2017-02-18 01:47</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>God yeah that's hard</br></br>2017-02-18 01:49</br>Rosemary Adams</br>It'll be okay. I think I need to get educated on how to deal with this and that can never hurt.</br></br>2017-02-18 01:50</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>True, I don't think there's ever a right way to deal with it</br>But trying to learn what other people think is helful could be good</br></br>2017-02-18 01:51</br>Rosemary Adams</br><3</br>tired</br></br>2017-02-18 01:52</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br><3 <3</br>Makes sense</br>Let me know how it goes in the morning</br></br>2017-02-18 01:52</br>Rosemary Adams</br>will do</br>sleep well</br></br>2017-02-18 01:53</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br></br>2017-02-18 01:53</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>You're the puppy</br></br>2017-02-19 03:47</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Life update: I've moved into delts permanently and carson is officially my boyfriend go team</br></br>2017-02-19 04:49</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Ayyy</br>Good work</br></br>2017-02-19 09:16</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Do you want to get morsel tomorrow?</br></br>2017-02-19 09:19</br>Rosemary Adams</br>sure!</br>we would be wise to go in the morning</br>the line gets out the door around 11:30</br></br>2017-02-19 09:20</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Hmm or we could go late at like 1:30</br>I like sleeping</br>Or we could go at like 10:30 that would be manageable</br></br>2017-02-19 09:21</br>Rosemary Adams</br>10:30 works better for me</br></br>2017-02-19 09:21</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Okay that's doable, and will force me and carson to get out there of bed before 3pm so probably a good thing</br></br>2017-02-19 09:22</br>Rosemary Adams</br>omg you two</br></br>2017-02-19 09:22</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>We got out at literally 5:30 yesterday it was bad</br>But also do you think they'd be closed for presidents day??</br></br>2017-02-19 09:24</br>Rosemary Adams</br>i doubt it</br>plus worst comes to worse we get coffee elsewhere</br></br>2017-02-19 09:24</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>True true</br>OK sounds like a plan</br></br>2017-02-19 09:25</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Meet on 47th?</br>actually where's delts</br></br>2017-02-19 09:25</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Lol I might not sleep there tonight we haven't actually talked about it</br>But it's on 19th, basically across from lambdas</br></br>2017-02-19 09:26</br>Rosemary Adams</br>ooh yeah</br>okay yeah 47th then</br></br>2017-02-19 09:26</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Yeah still works, sounds good</br></br>2017-02-19 09:26</br>Rosemary Adams</br>just lmk when you're headed up :) can't wait to see you</br></br>2017-02-19 09:29</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br><3</br></br>2017-02-20 12:18</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I'm getting my little and I matching notorious RBG shirts</br></br>2017-02-20 02:34</br>Rosemary Adams</br>You still want to go to the yule ball?</br></br>2017-02-20 02:42</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Is that this weekend? but yeah i'm still down</br></br>2017-02-20 02:42</br>Rosemary Adams</br>yeah it's saturday night</br>mini alcohols? :D</br></br>2017-02-20 02:44</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>hahah sounds good</br></br>2017-02-21 11:11</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Couple things I forgot to ask about/tell you</br>1.

encountered</br>that's not a bad thing, and it's taken you this long to get in hot water about it</br>I would call that an overall win</br></br>2017-02-21 10:34</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Awww you just

going back to regular next quarter</br></br>2017-02-21 10:35</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I think that is a wise choice</br></br>2017-02-21 10:35</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Yeah at least I know how to study for regular biochem even if it's hard it's possible</br></br>2017-02-21 10:35</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Do you have anything else in the class besides exams and that paper?</br>and this would be a good time to email your professors and ask if they have any tips</br></br>2017-02-21 10:36</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>The exams are papers, so we have another midterm paper and a final paper</br></br>2017-02-21

Thuesmunn</br>I'll make carson do it he likes writinf</br></br>2017-02-21 10:37</br>Rosemary Adams</br>but see</br>he's not a biochem expert</br>and that might be what you need</br></br>2017-02-21 10:38</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>But also I forgot what a time commitment being in a relationship was and it's stressing me out</br>EVERYTHING IS STRESS</br></br>2017-02-21 10:38</br>Rosemary

close!</br></br>2017-02-21 10:38</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Yeah biochem expert might be more helful but I'd feel weird asking someone in class since we're all answering the same questions</br></br>2017-02-21 10:39</br>Rosemary Adams</br>hmm</br>then ask obtusely just to make sure you're on the right track</br></br>2017-02-21 10:39</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Yeah I think that's a good idea</br>Part of the reason I did so ooorly is i started with a wrong assumption that then fucked me up</br>So I could clarify some basic things to start with</br>One girl did friend me on fb that could be my in</br></br>2017-02-21 10:40</br>Rosemary Adams</br>it is just hearing about this that makes me grateful that people in info just friend everyone in class and make a group chat to start off lol</br></br>2017-02-21 10:41</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>That would be a good idea honestly yeah</br>It would've been helful for this class too but it's kind of too late now</br>Okay I have a thousand things to do thanks for letting me vent I feel better</br></br>2017-02-21 10:41</br>Rosemary Adams</br>no prob bob</br>go accomplish all the things</br><3</br></br>2017-02-21 10:42</br>Zoe

Thuesmunn</br>idk how much the kitchen actually matters though because I feel like we wouldn't cook that much</br>because it's just kind of hard to cook like only 2 days worth of meals</br>BUT that doesn't really matter</br></br>2017-02-23 11:09</br>Rosemary Adams</br>yeah that is pretty negligable</br>I know my dad would be willing to supply some groceries at least though, so we could do a dope brunch with our weed syrup</br>do you wanna do it?</br></br>2017-02-23 11:10</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I'm down</br></br>2017-02-23 11:11</br>Rosemary Adams</br>okay so I guess you'll owe me $225</br></br>2017-02-23 11:11</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>that works</br>I'll venmo you</br></br>2017-02-23 11:11</br>Rosemary Adams</br>ahhh see nooo</br>that is too much for venmo</br></br>2017-02-23

Thuesmunn</br>yeah</br></br>2017-02-23 11:12</br>Rosemary Adams</br>ah</br>okay then</br></br>2017-02-23 11:12</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>you have to set it up</br>but it's not that hard you just need your account numbers and htings</br></br>2017-02-23 11:12</br>Rosemary Adams</br>hm</br>alrighty</br>idk I have heard bad things about venmo's security</br>but</br>its fine</br></br>2017-02-23 11:12</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>eh</br>it's probably safer to immediately transfer it out then</br>oh you mean of your passwords</br>idk</br></br>2017-02-23 11:13</br>Rosemary Adams</br>and bank accounts and such</br></br>2017-02-23 11:13</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>you can sue them if it leaks</br></br>2017-02-23 11:13</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I'll just let you know when I have it set up</br></br>2017-02-23 11:13</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>okedoke</br></br>2017-02-23 11:13</br>Rosemary Adams</br>or you can pay me like $175 and just put $50 into a booze pool</br>that seems excessive but you know what I mean</br></br>2017-02-23 11:14</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>damn do you think we're gonna drink $100 of alcohol</br></br>2017-02-23 11:14</br>Rosemary Adams</br>no</br></br>2017-02-23 11:14</br>Zoe

Thuesmunn</br>well I guess you can't buy alcohol anyway so you'd have to pay me back for that anyway</br>should we just wait until after and I can subtract what I spend from what I owe you?</br>or I

Adams</br>of course</br></br>2017-02-23 11:16</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>maybe they'll have those little bottles</br>like half fifths or whatever</br>OR we could try to split a fifth</br>we haven't done that since high school</br>if we have three nights that's a lot of drinking opportunities</br></br>2017-02-23 11:17</br>Rosemary Adams</br>oh god zoe I am splitting a fifth next weekend idk if I can

Damn you're rolling in it, comgrats!!</br></br>2017-02-24 05:10</br>Rosemary Adams</br>thanks!</br>I don't know what to do lol</br>so I have a career advising appointment for monday</br></br>2017-02-24 05:10</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>How did the interview go? Did you like them?</br></br>2017-02-24 05:10</br>Rosemary Adams</br>It was really awesome</br>I talked with Megan my recruiter again and then 3 female PM's!</br>#representation</br>so that was awesome</br>they seemed really overworked though and talked about working nights and so I'm not super about that</br>BUT I think what will help me most at this point is talking to an advisor about the benefits and drawbacks of doing a developer internship vs a PM one</br></br>2017-02-24 05:13</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Yeah that makes sense, at least you have options though!</br>Working nights would kind of suck though during the summer</br></br>2017-02-24 05:14</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Yes it would</br>But I think it's remote, so I could do it from home</br>Also its a super short car ride in, so if I end up doing it Carson and I could just split an uber in the mornings if he's down, then bus back</br>it would be a couple bucks a day but definitely worth saving the time</br>to me anyways lol</br>idk what I'm doing with my life</br>both of these internships are precursors to actual employment and that stresses me out</br></br>2017-02-24 05:18</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Couldn't you just try to get the bug and drive in?</br>Oh I guess your sister might still need it</br></br>2017-02-24 05:23</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Yeah she'll probably be working full time although she is currently unemployed so idk</br>although I am thinking about doing an every other week thing</br></br>2017-02-24 05:26</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>That'd be fair</br></br>2017-02-24 05:27</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I think so too, and then I could have it weekends for hiking and stuff</br>matthew very much so wants to go backpacking with me</br>I am nervous but its kind of not an option not to</br></br>2017-02-24 05:33</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>You could just try to stick with one night hikes? Kind of a compromise</br></br>2017-02-24 05:33</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I will literally be unable to do anything more with only weekends off so that works perfectly lol</br></br>2017-02-24 05:33</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>True</br></br>2017-02-24 05:33</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I also kind of want to have time off though so we'll see</br></br>2017-02-24 05:34</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Plus it's a good excuse to spend time together and get out in nature</br></br>2017-02-24 05:34</br>Rosemary Adams</br>That's how I view it, but sometimes it feels like he is more interested in climbing things than spending time with me</br>BUT</br></br>2017-02-24 05:34</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I'm excited for us both to work regular schedules though! For kind of the first time in our lives</br></br>2017-02-24 05:34</br>Rosemary Adams</br>we've talked about it</br>I know!!!</br></br>2017-02-24 05:34</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Hmmm true, but I think he could be equally interested in both</br></br>2017-02-24 05:35</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I think at the core of it he is, but sometimes it doesn't come across that way.

don't</br></br>2017-02-27 01:45</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>That's true, only working until 5 or 6 would honestly be surreal</br></br>2017-02-27 01:45</br>Rosemary Adams</br>weekends off?!</br>like totally

cute</br></br>2017-03-01 11:03</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Okay is it bad that I don't have a lot of sympathy for Carson having to stay up until 6am to do homework? Because he doesn't really do anything besides school but he does that a lot and I honestly don't really understand what he does during the day</br>And i wouldn't care except that I want to hang out with him, or at the very least sleep/cuddle with him but he's constantly pulling all nighters lol and I feel like he's not making an effort</br>And i know it's not really fair to compare other people to me but also I do so much and am still available more than him so it's kind if frustrating</br>Okay rant over</br></br>2017-03-01 11:14</br>Rosemary Adams</br>SO IT BEGINS</br></br>2017-03-01 11:14</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I know. It had to happen sometime</br></br>2017-03-01 11:16</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I do agree that constantly pulling all nighters seems weird and it makes me think that he just has a hard time staying focused</br>or is a perfectionist</br></br>2017-03-01 11:17</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>It's not all the time but he basically always stays up until at least 3</br></br>2017-03-01 11:17</br>Rosemary Adams</br>and yes it's not fair to compare people to yourself but you're not wrong in that you do more stuff and generally have a better handle on your free time</br></br>2017-03-01 11:17</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I think it's just his study habits</br></br>2017-03-01 11:17</br>Rosemary Adams</br>that's what it sounds like</br>which is a bummer for planning things</br></br>2017-03-01 11:18</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Yeah exactly</br>Ugh</br>I just wish he would get more done during the day</br></br>2017-03-01 11:19</br>Rosemary Adams</br>How far ahead do you plan on hanging out?</br></br>2017-03-01 11:19</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Not usually very far ahead, but we also don't really hang out during the week</br></br>2017-03-01 11:19</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Matt and I usually try to do one to two days in advance and always talk about the weekends like a week in advance so that we can get our respective homeworks done</br>not that it's that formal it's just what works</br>but he also doesn't have that much homework so</br></br>2017-03-01 11:20</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Yeah honestly we only hang out on the weekends though, which we do talk about, but that's part of the reason I'm frustrated</br>I just want to see him more 😔</br></br>2017-03-01 11:20</br>Rosemary Adams</br>AW</br>have you tried talking to him about it</br></br>2017-03-01 11:21</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>No I haven't seen him since Saturday lol but I think I will bring it up next time</br></br>2017-03-01 11:21</br>Rosemary Adams</br>or maybe asking to get coffee during the day sometime? I really like doing that if we both have a free hour or so</br></br>2017-03-01 11:21</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>That honestly wouldn't work for me, I'm basically busy full time during the week</br></br>2017-03-01 11:22</br>Rosemary Adams</br>yeah that was a long shot</br></br>2017-03-01 11:22</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>But it's a good suggestion</br></br>2017-03-01 11:22</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I sometimes forget that you can hang out without cuddling or being together for many hours so midday is actually viable sometimes lol</br>did you still want to see DMC on sunday?</br></br>2017-03-01 11:24</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Hahaha valid, idk partially it's just that this is the same problem I had with Keegan over and over again so I don't want to just seem needy because that never got better from talking about it</br>Also crap I totally forgot about that</br></br>2017-03-01 11:25</br>Rosemary Adams</br>no worries, I totally get it if you're busy</br></br>2017-03-01 11:25</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Yeah I might just need to Sunday studying sorry 😔 but I'll let you know</br></br>2017-03-01 11:26</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I figured as much, I can just ask Matt to come along if you're busy :)</br>and yes this problem is very keegany, and I don't think it's needy to want to see your boyfriend once or twice during the week</br></br>2017-03-01 11:28</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Idk I just don't want it to come across as "I do more than you and you're not good enough because you can't manage your time"</br>Obviously I would phrase it more nicely</br></br>2017-03-01 11:28</br>Rosemary Adams</br>you don't have to say it that way at all</br>he's not trying to slight you by living his life like this, but it might be that he just needs you guys to schedule like a wednesday hang out in or whatever</br>and if you come at it from "I just want to see you a lil bit more" rather than "I *should* be able to see you if you were more on top of your shit*</br>then it just opens up the conversation</br>and he seems really receptive to you so I think you just need to tell him</br>also okay side convo is nithya (sahiti) in a cult now</br></br>2017-03-01 11:33</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I am honestly not surr</br>I can't tell if she's like actually on live with that guy or what</br></br>2017-03-01 11:33</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I think she worships him?</br></br>2017-03-01 11:34</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>The whole thing makes me kind of uncomfortable but she also seems really happy?

Each year, Avanade holds a TechSummit on the Microsoft campus in Redmond, where they invite their key industry partners to come together for panel discussions, presentations and networking events. This year’s summit takes place June 12 – 14. Because of Avanade’s relationship with the iSchool, Chief Technology & Innovation Officer Chris Miller has made five spots available for iSchool students to attend. He has asked us to identify our top five female students in the Informatics and MSIM programs who would benefit from attending the summit, which this year focuses on women in technology."</br></br>2017-03-02 11:46</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I'm crying</br>I'm going</br>I'm dying</br>so many emotions! lol</br></br>2017-03-02 11:58</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Awwwwwww2</br>That's so cool!!!!</br>Congrats!</br></br>2017-03-04 04:39</br>Rosemary Adams</br>it happened!</br>today is the day!</br>happy 8 year friendaversary</br>facebook decided not to do anything cute about it though whatever facebook</br></br>2017-03-04 04:46</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Wtf fb</br></br>2017-03-04 04:50</br>Rosemary Adams</br>right</br>it's just salty about our love</br>also how did you get a birth control implant and not feaking tell me in something that wasn't snapchat cmon now</br></br>2017-03-04 05:20</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Wait no there's a friendship video</br>It's kinda bad though</br>Also I feel like I told you about that!</br>We definitely had a conversation about it</br></br>2017-03-04 05:43</br>Rosemary Adams</br>mmmm</br>i don't remember this</br>I remember you talking about maybe getting an IUD but that was it</br>dude I don't have a video wtf</br>spruce that shit up and share it</br></br>2017-03-04 09:16</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>How's info party?</br></br>2017-03-04 09:19</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Not there yet!

I'm not sure what I even wanted it to be</br></br>2017-04-02 11:32</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>it's hard to know how receptive she'd be to regular conversation</br>when does she go to standards?</br></br>2017-04-02 11:32</br>Rosemary Adams</br>She is getting notification of the letter tomorrow probably, standards has to coordinate with peoples schedules but probably sometime this week</br></br>2017-04-02 11:32</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>ah fun</br>so the drama is about to beign</br>begin</br></br>2017-04-02 11:33</br>Rosemary Adams</br>idk if there will actually be drama, standards is required to be discreet, so it will just be between us (hopefully) and we can both handle that</br>considering we have</br>for like two quarters</br>and thankfully the whole house has pretty much moved on</br></br>2017-04-02 11:35</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>That's true</br></br>2017-04-02 11:36</br>Rosemary Adams</br>anyways</br>I can't wait to see you</br>:)</br></br>2017-04-02 11:37</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Hahaha yeah it'll be fun</br></br>2017-04-05 12:44</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Do you and Carson want tickets to tbe opera?

And if you can't make three times work then it might be time to set him loose for his own sake</br></br>2017-04-23 09:14</br>Rosemary Adams</br>omg he unfriended me on facebook</br>oohhh man</br></br>2017-04-23 09:21</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Matt did???</br></br>2017-04-23 09:29</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Yupp</br>I mostly think its funny</br>But he was trying to unfollow me after I posted the formal picture</br></br>2017-04-23 09:30</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>damn</br>wait so what did you say to him earlier?</br></br>2017-04-23 09:30</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Oh yeah I agreed obviously</br>But like he wants to hang out on thursday</br>And I have a cse midterm the next day so</br>Idk I agreed to 3 days because thats reasonable as fuck but this week is not gonna be easy</br></br>2017-04-23 09:34</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Why did he unfriendyou??</br>That is bad timing with the CS midterm, could you just hang out earlier in the week?</br>But yeah unfriending you seems really dramatic if your guys aren't actually breaking up</br></br>2017-04-23 09:40</br>Rosemary Adams</br>He was trying to unfollow me</br>Idk I also have a midterm on thursday</br>And oh yeah I get to lecture in front of 200 people on tuesday</br></br>2017-04-23 09:44</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>But why was he trying to unfollow you? Because hey didnt like the picture you posted?</br>ooh exciting</br>It does seem like this isn't the best week to start but it also seems like you don't really have a choice at this point</br></br>2017-04-23 09:47</br>Rosemary Adams</br>yeah he unfollowed me on instagram too</br>so yes this week isn't the best week</br>I'm curious what will happen if we don't hang out three times</br>frick</br></br>2017-04-23 09:48</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Did you basically explain that this was a bad time?</br></br>2017-04-23 09:49</br>Rosemary Adams</br>yeah I did like tell him what is going on this week</br>but he also isn't a great listener all the time</br>I accepted his friend request</br></br>2017-04-23 09:51</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>yeah and he's probably not that sympathetic at this point even if you are busier than usual</br>hmmmmm</br></br>2017-04-23 09:52</br>Rosemary Adams</br>yeah if I were in his shoes I would definitely be over the excuses pretty much regardless</br>oh no now he wants to go facebook official</br></br>2017-04-23 09:53</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>wow this is a rollercoaster of facebok days</br>How are you feeling about the ultimatum situation?</br></br>2017-04-23 09:53</br>Rosemary Adams</br>bad</br>I hate ultimatums</br></br>2017-04-23 09:54</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>yeah I don't think they're the healthiest way of processing issues</br></br>2017-04-23 09:54</br>Rosemary Adams</br>because now I have this like stupid check list of hangouts instead of actually wanting to hang out</br>can I just not respond to him</br>is that allowed with your own boyfriend</br></br>2017-04-23 09:57</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Yeah kind of takes the fun out of it</br>Not respond to what?</br></br>2017-04-23 10:03</br>Rosemary Adams</br>His relationship thing</br></br>2017-04-23 10:06</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>That does seem like something you should talk about in person</br>Why don't you want to? Remaining Astrid drama?</br>Or because you secretly think you'll break up soon and don't want to go facebook official and then go back on it</br></br>2017-04-23 10:09</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Bingo</br></br>2017-04-23 10:09</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>That's rough</br>but hard to talk to him abot that</br></br>2017-04-23 10:09</br>Rosemary Adams</br>He's really pushing the issue here</br>So post midterms we are gonna have to talk about it</br>Like it feels like a last ditch effort to guilt me into staying?</br>Things are going well and theres no way he thinks that issuing ultimatums is a good place to be making moves like this</br>Excuse me things are not going well</br></br>2017-04-23 10:15</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Yeah it definitely kind of feels like a panic move on his part, which isn't super surprising though honestly considering the situation</br>but yeah if he feels like your relationship is in trouble ultimatums and panic unfollowing and then facebook official moves just looks like he's foundering</br>It would definitely be better if you didn't have so many midterms this week, because it seems like you guys need to talk now</br>Have you planned your three hangouts this week?</br></br>2017-04-23 10:18</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Well I saw him twice today and then I can probably see him again on Saturday or late Friday</br></br>2017-04-23 10:18</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>does twice in one day count lol?</br></br>2017-04-23 10:19</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Lol I hope so haha</br></br>2017-04-23 10:19</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>hahahah</br></br>2017-04-23 10:19</br>Rosemary Adams</br>If I were the TA of our relationship I would count it</br>And I am so</br></br>2017-04-23 10:19</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I don't know if you are the TA of your relationship</br></br>2017-04-23 10:19</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I feel so bad for him</br></br>2017-04-23 10:20</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>or if that is a real position</br></br>2017-04-23 10:20</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Shh</br>If we are having a rubric then someone has to grade it</br></br>2017-04-23 10:20</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>My gues is he wont count two in one day, but since youres so buys if you hang out fri/sat that seems fair</br>what did you guys talk about when you hung out today?</br>It seems like some of these things should have come up</br></br>2017-04-23 10:20</br>Rosemary Adams</br>House stuff, we had a pretty brutal exec</br></br>2017-04-23 10:20</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>oh no not more house drama</br></br>2017-04-23 10:21</br>Rosemary Adams</br>u no it</br>astrid was basically just playing the victim and was really upset for getting kicked out and was like oh valentina and I feel really attacked all the time</br>and I had to bite my tongue because she was being sooooo goddamn hypocritical</br>like just saying all this stuff about how we need to be out best and to stop shit talking and whatever</br>and I am just baffled because she's kind of the worst</br>but yeah I have become a professional at avoiding important conversations</br></br>2017-04-23 10:24</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Damn</br>so much drama</br>Yeah working with Astrid sounds super annoying honestly</br>I think with Astrid it's okay to avoid the conversations because they would probably be pointless, but with Matt you probably need to actually talk to him pretty soon</br>But I'm surprised if he was feeling all of these intense things about your relationship about the ultimatums and facebook officialing and being mad that you posted the picture of Brendan that that would have come up when you were together</br></br>2017-04-23 10:29</br>Rosemary Adams</br>It sort of came up this morning</br>I think he's afraid that if he pushes it I'll leave</br>Astrid sucks</br></br>2017-04-23 10:37</br>Rosemary Adams</br></br>2017-04-23 10:37</br>Rosemary Adams</br>What is this about I wonder</br></br>2017-04-23 10:49</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>wow thats dramatic</br>Isnt that the whole point of the ultimatum though to push it to force you</br>but seriously passive aggressive instagram posts</br></br>2017-04-23 10:50</br>Rosemary Adams</br>yeah he requested to follow me on instagram</br>in the spirit of this whole social media mess I declined</br></br>2017-04-23 10:51</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Yeah he really asked for that one</br>but also what</br></br>2017-04-23 10:51</br>Rosemary Adams</br>i don't know man</br></br>2017-04-23 10:51</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>You guys need to stop having this fight over social media follows</br></br>2017-04-23 10:52</br>Rosemary Adams</br>isn't it the pettiest shit</br></br>2017-04-23 10:53</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I think the best move is to honestly just be annoying and postpone having serious talks until you can do it with a clear mind post midterms</br>Take your studies seriously and then actually have this talk with Matt</br>and maybe calm down with the pettiness first too</br></br>2017-04-23 10:53</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I agree with that plan.</br>and hey I was not the instigator of the stupid social media stuff</br></br>2017-04-23 10:55</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Now you just have to survive the week without breaking Matt's heart</br>Yeah I know I mainly meant that towards Matt</br></br>2017-04-23 10:55</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I'm seriously not going to worry about it. I gotta do stuff and that is what's occupying my mind.</br></br>2017-04-23 10:56</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Yeah that's probably for the best</br></br>2017-04-24 10:29</br>Rosemary Adams</br>everything is falling apart</br>Madison finally told me all the horrible shit Astrid did to her</br>including literal cyber bullying</br>and then today at chapter Astrid gave "pearls to" (which idk if you do but its a way to recognize when sisters help you or go above and beyond or whatever, ex "pearls to zoe for being a dope president") anyways she gave pearls to THE GIRLS SHE GOT KICKED OUT OF FORMAL WITH</br>I thought some of our seniors eyes were going to get stuck in the backs of their heads from rolling them so hard</br>and she played the victim for an hour about getting kicked out at exec on sunday</br>and now Madison is going to resign from exec because our president doesn't defend her at all</br>yayy</br></br>2017-04-24 11:33</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>ohhh no</br>wait so what did she do to Madison/why?</br>And what position was she?</br>Also did she give a reason for why she was giving them pearls?</br>ugh its all so petty</br>Although I honestly wouldn't blame you guys for wanting to resign</br>being on exec is enough work without it being a huge drama fest</br></br>2017-04-25 01:10</br>Rosemary Adams</br>So Valentina commented on a gif that said "when you tell someone to go fuck themselves" tagging astrid and saying #jollygiant (Madison's nickname in high school) and they both simultaneously liked madison's shirt size for the philanthropy shirts :(</br>Madison is our Standards/Ops so when I wrote that letter she had to deal with it and I feel so bad for doing that to her because Astrid got super mega nasty about it</br>And her reason for pearls was for "Having such a fun night with her"</br>Yeah I'm having a meeting with kristen asking her to do something tomorrow because otherwise it's going to be a complete shit show on Friday at exec</br>but in other news matt wanted to talk tonight about why I was upset and we ended up breaking up over the phone so I just stopped crying</br>Brendan is totally in love with me so I need to stop talking to him about this stuff</br>He brought me ice cream :( to be fair I had left some in his freezer but still</br></br>2017-04-25 01:14</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>OH SHIT</br>so what happened with Matt?</br>That seems like the most important piece of news</br></br>2017-04-25 01:17</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I called him, laid it all out there and started crying, he kept asking me why I felt certain ways and asking me to just try</br>I knew how it would go down and it sucks that it was over the phone but he really wanted to talk about it now</br>Said he was worried that I would say what I did</br>I feel like a terrible person</br>I feel like I was the worst thing to ever happen to him</br>I could hear him sobbing on the other end</br>It was horrible</br></br>2017-04-25 01:19</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>oh man, over the phone really isn't ideal. You're definitely not teh worst thing to ever happen to him</br>Yeah once you start that talk there's not a lot of stopping it</br></br>2017-04-25 01:21</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Yeah it was time</br></br>2017-04-25 01:21</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>But you guys had some very good times, so while I'm sure he's sad now you shouldn't feel bad about your relationship overall</br></br>2017-04-25 01:22</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I just feel so bad that a year ago I did this to him and now I did it again</br>but I wasn't happy</br>and frankly I was wasting his time</br></br>2017-04-25 01:22</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Yeah, you definitely did the right thing</br>It didn't make sense to stay in the relationship if it was mainly just causing you stress</br>Do you think you'll see him again in person?</br></br>2017-04-25 01:27</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I'm not sure</br>He asked to see me on Saturday</br>but I think I need to go home and get away from this house for a little bit</br>and I'm also not sure if seeing him again is a good idea</br></br>2017-04-25 01:28</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Yeah it seems like your entire life has exploded in an eruption of drama and it might be good to get away</br>It seems fair to see him to make things official in person, but it would also probably be really hard and emotionally draining and not actually very productive</br></br>2017-04-25 01:31</br>Rosemary Adams</br>yeah and we have this exec meeting scheduled for friday and it is going to get very ugly</br>man</br>I just want Astrid to be a normal person</br>but yeah I think some home time is warrented and I also don't know if I can look at Matt without sobbing</br>but I am a sad girl</br>and at the moment things are bleak</br>so I might need to get bubble tea with you or something if you have time</br></br>2017-04-25 01:36</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>It's okay you'll make it through this week and then things wont be so bleak</br>After my midterm tomorrow my week clears up so let me know when you're free and we can definitely get bubble tea :)</br></br>2017-04-25 01:40</br>Rosemary Adams</br><3</br>yaay</br></br>2017-04-25 01:43</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br></br>2017-04-25 01:43</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br></br>2017-04-25 09:58</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br></br>2017-04-25 09:59</br>Rosemary Adams</br><3</br></br>2017-04-25 10:00</br>Rosemary Adams</br></br>2017-04-25 10:00</br>Rosemary Adams</br></br>2017-04-25 10:19</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I've been communicating my feelings through memes these days</br>Talked to Kristen today about how frustrated I am, she is going to do nothing about it</br>Even though she is equally as unhappy about astrids behavior</br>Our advisor is a really big fan of mediation and doesn't believe in any other form of conflict resolution even though Kristen has spoken with astrid numerous times</br></br>2017-04-25 10:21</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Sometimes memes are the best way</br>ugh Kristen</br>Although I don't know what she can really do besides talk to her</br></br>2017-04-25 10:30</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Be more stern</br>Like I just don't think she's coming across as someone who needs to be respected</br></br>2017-04-25 10:37</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Yeah she doesn't have a very commanding presence, because I think it's time for a somewhat serious confrontation</br>Astrid needs some tough love from your exec board</br>that's probably more tough than love</br></br>2017-04-25 10:41</br>Rosemary Adams</br>seriously</br>if she were enter the workplace right now and do this shit she would be fired</br>and I feel like this is a safer environment to remind her of that fact</br></br>2017-04-26 07:43</br>Rosemary Adams</br>If you have 15 minutes you will love this</br></br>2017-04-26 07:43</br>Rosemary Adams</br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btxZGzWlsMw&feature=youtu.be</br></br>2017-04-26 07:43</br>Rosemary Adams</br>It's about music, language, lyrics and culture and it's really cool</br>Tempted to send this to someone at Skyline who can show it in an IB music class because honestly this is the level of thinking that should be going on in that class</br></br>2017-04-26 08:08</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Looks cool! I'll watch it later</br></br>2017-04-27 07:23</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I watched it with Carson lol, it was really interesting! It makes me want to see Moana</br>Also how are things?</br></br>2017-04-27 07:30</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Moana is so fun.</br>Things are not great, but they are getting better. Finished a midterm today, just need to make it through my midterm tomorrow</br>And exec I guess, but I have stopped caring about that. Kristen is finally considering a membership review thank god. Astrid has been written to standards twice in a quarter for gods sake.</br>I finally had to ask my big and my roommate to stop talking to me about it. It was just too much.</br>Are you two coming on the boat?</br></br>2017-04-27 07:38</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Damn I'm surprised she'd go that far, but it does seem warranted since she is causing so much drama and basically tearing the house apart</br>I don't know we haven't talked about it recently I'll ask him about again</br>Are you still going home this weekend?</br></br>2017-04-27 07:43</br>Rosemary Adams</br>If he didn't buy them then you guys are outta luck. But the good news is I have an extra ticket so I can steal your boyfriend and make him hang out with info people 😈 jk will probably just give it to someone on the waitlist</br>And yeah, that's the plan</br></br>2017-04-27 07:45</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>lol yeah I don't think he bought them, oh well</br>You don't want to take Brendan again?</br></br>2017-04-27 07:50</br>Rosemary Adams</br>He's taking someone</br>And to be honest our philanthropy is the same night and our philanthropy chair keeps threatening to drop so if she does I won't be able to go anyways</br></br>2017-04-27 07:52</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>ah okay makes sense</br>Yeah that sucks, but I guess someone would have to run the feed</br>Do you think she will drop?</br></br>2017-04-27 07:58</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I have no idea. She keeps saying she hasn't paid her dues yet because she's unsure but then keeps signing up for stuff later this quarter with the house and hadn't spoken with Kristen until today because I nagged the crap out of both of them to meet</br>And like she wants her phone number on the philanthropy flier</br>She's also not around at all though</br></br>2017-04-27 08:04</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>it sounds like she might just be being dramatic</br>which wouldn't be unprecedented at this point</br></br>2017-04-27 08:10</br>Rosemary Adams</br>lol I don't have time for this man</br></br>2017-04-27 08:16</br>Rosemary Adams</br>She's disaffiliated!</br>That sucks</br>ugh</br></br>2017-04-27 08:20</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>wait did that literally just happen?</br></br>2017-04-27 08:21</br>Rosemary Adams</br>yeup</br></br>2017-04-27 08:21</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>wow</br></br>2017-04-27 08:21</br>Rosemary Adams</br>she just got out of a meeting with kristen</br>and so kristen messaged me</br>say hello to the grumpiest exec member and chair position holder in the world</br></br>2017-04-27 08:22</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br></br>2017-04-27 08:22</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>DOes that mean you guys elect someone new as philanthropy chair?</br></br>2017-04-27 08:23</br>Rosemary Adams</br>for fall yes</br>for right now I get to inherit it because I am in charge of the position</br></br>2017-04-27 08:24</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>oh fun</br>At least it's mostly planned already?

I understand that there is limited time and you are in an unfortunate position, and I really want to work with you in every way possible, such as when I told you I could announce it Saturday evening instead of Sunday as I would prefer to. I would be happy to supervise passing out flyers as I have offered my assistance many times, but you're going to need to ask me nicely instead of trying to use it as a negotiation tool"</br></br>2017-04-27 11:32</br>Rosemary Adams</br>"I understand that you're stressed, and I definitely am too, so please know that I too am coming from the nicest possible place"</br>fuck being nice</br></br>2017-04-27 11:32</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>hmmm</br>is she still talking at this brunch even though she dropped?</br>or is that not relevant to this conversation</br></br>2017-04-27 11:33</br>Rosemary Adams</br>it is</br></br>2017-04-27 11:33</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>also damn @ you're gonna need to ask me nicely that's savage</br></br>2017-04-27 11:33</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I tried to say she can drop her position before she disaffiliates and that gives me the mobility to start working</br></br>2017-04-27 11:34</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>yeah that makes sense</br>ALthoughI guess you do still have a couple weeks</br>but not a couple weeks of free time so I see why you want to start now</br></br>2017-04-27 11:35</br>Rosemary Adams</br>a week and a half</br>two weekends</br>one exec meeting</br>only one weekend where I have the time to do anything</br>BECAUSE THE NEXT WEEKEND IS FUCKING GREEK PREVIEW</br></br>2017-04-28 12:06</br>Rosemary Adams</br>it's fine</br>it's her job now</br></br>2017-04-28 12:27</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>So she wouldn't budge on announcing her retirement?</br>I'm glad you stuck to your guns though</br></br>2017-04-28 12:28</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Yep, Kristen started suggesting all this stuff so I said</br>"It sounds like you have a lot of really good ideas Kristen, and have a better handle on this then me.

06:16</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Is this willful ignorance or am I confused</br></br>2017-04-29 07:15</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I'm not sure</br>Seems like she's not taking responsibility for it though</br>And seems to think you still are</br></br>2017-04-29 07:36</br>Rosemary Adams</br>She's pulling the bylaws on me</br></br>2017-04-29 07:40</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Ugh</br>Do the bylaws say you have to do it?</br></br>2017-04-29 07:44</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Our chapter ones don't</br>I have no idea about the national ones</br></br>2017-04-29 08:10</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Hahahahaha they

Kristen that and that we should probably get a new philanthropy chair</br>I'm not being a good exec member</br>I'll admit to that</br>But she is handling this quite poorly</br></br>2017-04-29 08:24</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Maybe you should ask the chapter if anyone wants to take on philanthropy chair</br>There might be someone that actually wants the position</br></br>2017-04-29 08:24</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Yeah I hope she does that that is definitely the best solution</br>I know there is too</br></br>2017-05-01 11:39</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Ps guardians of tbe galaxy 2 comes

her having allergies?</br>Interesting development though</br></br>2017-05-04 03:53</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Allergies typically present as sinus issues</br>So does being on coke</br>So we did a random room check today and I emailed all the advisers calling for her to leave her position and to conduct a membership review</br></br>2017-05-04 04:04</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I mean technically is her being on coke againt the rules? as long as it's not in the house</br></br>2017-05-04 04:06</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Yeah it's not but like if you're dropping exec because you really need to focus on getting into grad school but you're doing a bunch of coke instead</br>idk</br>seems fishy to me</br></br>2017-05-04 04:07</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>hahaha true</br>good point</br>well she's got important cocaine

I feel like I remember you saying Matt was getting tested since he'd been sleeping around but maybe I made that up</br>Good that you got tested though. What are the symptoms like?</br></br>2017-05-09 12:46</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I thought he did too but I guess that never happened</br>Actually I think he did before he started seeing astrid</br>and the symptoms oh man</br></br>2017-05-09 12:46</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Ugh</br></br>2017-05-09 12:46</br>Rosemary Adams</br>so it's not the same chlamydia as before because the last one was vaginal</br>this one is rectal</br>so</br>it's itchy</br></br>2017-05-09 12:47</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Oh damn so do you have to tell Adair that you may have given him chlamydia again??</br>Oh my god</br></br>2017-05-09 12:47</br>Rosemary Adams</br>well</br></br>2017-05-09 12:47</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I know I asked for it but damn</br></br>2017-05-09 12:47</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Haha yeah I know</br>and both matt and I have been having these symptoms for months and not thought anything of it</br>but now that we know it makes so much more sense</br>don't tell carson</br>Like I know you tell him everything and that is totally fine but this one maybe not lol</br></br>2017-05-09 12:48</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Are you sure it's a good warning for safe sex</br>But I'm glad that you've solved your itchy butt mystery</br>Carson was so anti getting tested for STDs THESE THINGS HAPPEN</br>But I won't tell him if you don't want me to</br></br>2017-05-09 12:50</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I would appreciate that yes thank you</br>You can just rest easy knowing that getting tested was a good call</br>and pass that on to your children</br></br>2017-05-09 12:51</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Hahah okay your secrets safe with me</br></br>2017-05-09 12:51</br>Rosemary Adams</br>but</br>yeah</br>I'm getting meds tomorrow</br>and I told Devin but I haven't told adair yet</br>because holy lord</br>even though the exact same thing happened to him last time</br>I am forever unclean</br>plus Adair and i used protection and didn't do butt stuff so I think he's probably fine</br></br>2017-05-09 12:55</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>So you're not going to tell him?</br></br>2017-05-09 12:56</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Of course I am going to</br>I just haven't yet</br></br>2017-05-09 12:56</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Ah okay that's good</br>But damn you two are cursed</br></br>2017-05-09 12:57</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I know 😭</br>I'm so excited to get better though</br>I hope it hasnt done any permanent damage</br></br>2017-05-09 12:59</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I hope so too</br>Since its not in your vagina though I feel like that might be better?</br>I'm not really sure how that works</br></br>2017-05-09 01:05</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Me either</br>Fortunately IUGA is making a Costco run and its just me and Brendan so I can get my meds tomorrow instead of this weekend lol</br></br>2017-05-09 01:06</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Lol did you tell brendan?</br>Also apparently some girl from info has asked Carson on the boat formal like 8 times but he keeps saying no lol</br></br>2017-05-09 01:07</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Hahahahahaha</br>No I'm not gonna tell him</br>I would rather no one in info know</br>Who is this chick</br></br>2017-05-09 01:12</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Idk she's in ADD though</br>I think she might be in IUGA?</br>But I don't know her namr</br>AXiD*</br></br>2017-05-09 01:14</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Is that a house?</br></br>2017-05-09

know 3 girls in info in houses besides myself so I have no idea who that might be</br>Shes def not in iuga though</br></br>2017-05-09 01:18</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I think she might have ran for a position and not gotten it</br>I know I talked to her about it once</br>None of this is very relevant though</br>Who are you taking on the boat formal?</br></br>2017-05-09 01:19</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Andy Johnson</br>Fiji</br>Rugby player</br>Built as fuck</br>Not really as my date but I wanted him to come so I offered him my extra ticket</br></br>2017-05-09 01:25</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Damn</br>Are you sure it's not a date</br>He sounds cute</br></br>2017-05-09 01:26</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Haha I have no idea</br></br>2017-05-09 01:26</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>It's definitely a date</br></br>2017-05-09 01:26</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Hes actually technically my student but whatever</br></br>2017-05-09 01:26</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Hahahaha nice</br>Is he currently your student?</br>Are you guys going to drink together?</br></br>2017-05-09 01:37</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Hes not in my section but he is a 201 student currently</br>And I don't know!!</br>I'm trying to be cool about it</br>But hes got a bunch of Greek week events before that and I like asked if he wanted to prefunk at his place but he was very medium about it</br>I also don't get out of class until 5:30 and the boat leaves at 7 so its kind of crunchy</br>I'm willing to leave early</br>But only if he wants to actually hang out</br>Otherwise there are a couple other prefunks I could go to</br></br>2017-05-09 01:41</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I think you could make it</br>Hmm</br>What do you mean medium about it?</br></br>2017-05-09 01:41</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Just very non committal</br></br>2017-05-09 01:41</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Men</br>What can you do</br></br>2017-05-09 01:42</br>Rosemary Adams</br>He's got a pool party thing before that will probably end at 3 ish and I really am doing my best to be cool and aloof and abstain from planning</br>I am also on the hunt for a typical slutty sorority dress so lmk if you have anything like that</br></br>2017-05-09 01:46</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Hahah classic</br>Wear your black dresa</br>The one I wore in fall</br></br>2017-05-09 01:46</br>Rosemary Adams</br>ooooo</br>I forgot I had that one lol</br></br>2017-05-09 01:46</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I got you</br>Also do you think my matching skirt/crop top outfit is too casual to wear to formal?</br>Cause ours is this Friday and I'm out of dresses</br></br>2017-05-09 01:48</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I think it works</br>Its ballet fancy and thats a pretty good gauge</br></br>2017-05-09 01:48</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>It's very springy</br></br>2017-05-09 01:48</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Its hella cute + trendy</br></br>2017-05-09 01:48</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>It's either that or my red dress</br></br>2017-05-09 01:48</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Oooh saucy</br>Not very springy</br></br>2017-05-09 01:48</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>You could borrow my red one too if you want</br>Yeah less springy</br></br>2017-05-09 01:51</br>Rosemary

easy because of male penetration, I just don't see how her fluids would get in his ass</br>But I should probably just not worry about it</br></br>2017-05-10 04:43</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I don't really

I have a lot of good darker colors that you haven't worn</br>Actually you could borrow my white dress if you want that would be really cute</br>Not my white tent dress but the one with the cutout triangles in front</br></br>2017-05-11 12:03</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Idk If I know that one</br>Oh wait I remember it</br>No I think it'll be okay I think I'll go with the purple</br></br>2017-05-11 12:09</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Tomorrow or for your formal?</br></br>2017-05-11 12:09</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I don't even know anymore</br></br>2017-05-11 12:12</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Okay so Carson has class until 6:30</br>So he doesn't have much time to prefunk, so I might just ditch him and go with you? Would that be mean?</br></br>2017-05-11 12:14</br>Rosemary Adams</br>That sounds fine to me but you should probably ask him lol</br></br>2017-05-11 12:14</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I don't think he'd care but I'll ask him</br></br>2017-05-11 01:35</br>Rosemary Adams</br>And I will ask Babbs</br></br>2017-05-11 01:39</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Who is babbs</br>You can just pretend I'm your date</br></br>2017-05-11 01:41</br>Rosemary Adams</br>But my date will actually be there</br>Babbs is hosting</br>I'm sure it will be fine</br></br>2017-05-11 01:43</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Shhhh</br>I'm a better date than non-committal fiji</br>Tell him we're polyamorous</br></br>2017-05-11 04:38</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I still have homework to do so I'm not sure if I'll be able to be ready by 5:45</br>because I still need to run to safeway also</br></br>2017-05-11 04:53</br>Rosemary Adams</br>You can share a fifth with me and Andy don't worry about it</br></br>2017-05-11 04:54</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>but I should also get alcohol for carson</br>That he can chug in the 15 minutes he has to prefunk lol</br></br>2017-05-11 04:56</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Aahahaha</br>True</br></br>2017-05-11 04:56</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>But he's kind of sick so I was just going to get wine or something slightly more mellow than hard alcohol</br>but he also just said he has a runny nose and sore throat so I think he's kind of being a baby but don't tell him i said that</br></br>2017-05-11 04:58</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Hahhahahahaha</br>Men</br>Maybe he has the mumps</br>Actually he might be having allergies</br></br>2017-05-11 04:59</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>who knows</br>I think it is maily that his nose is super runny so you're right that's probably just bad allergies</br>ALthough he did tell me once he wasn't allergic to anything</br>part of his super genes</br>but yeah either way I'm probably going to be late</br>I think I can realistically be there by 6:30 though if it wouldn't be weird for me to show up along</br>when are you guys going to leave?</br></br>2017-05-11 05:05</br>Rosemary Adams</br>6:30 is pretty late</br>I am aiming to be down there by 7:30</br>So leave at 7:10</br></br>2017-05-11 05:06</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>hmm</br>okay I could probably be there sooner</br>if I just don't do my physics lol but that's fine</br></br>2017-05-11 05:07</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Is it due tonight??</br></br>2017-05-11 05:07</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>yeah</br>but I can do it for the points and just google the answers I just wont do the learning</br></br>2017-05-11 05:07</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Classic</br></br>2017-05-11 05:09</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>but I also have to finish an essay</br>well it's done but finish editing

really</br>But</br>It works</br></br>2017-05-11 06:21</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>At this rate I'm thinking it might be better for me and carson to just prefunk at delts and meet you guys there for the sake of time</br></br>2017-05-11 06:27</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Agreed</br></br>2017-05-11 06:33</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>carson's never leaving class anyways</br></br>2017-05-11 06:38</br>Zoe

Thuesmunn</br>Sorry we got back and immediately had sex and fell asleep</br>But we ubered back with some info buds</br></br>2017-05-12 12:24</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>It was a fun formal!</br>Sorry we didn't make it to your feed 😭</br></br>2017-05-12 12:25</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Its okay</br>I twisted my ankle :(</br></br>2017-05-12 12:31</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Awww when did that happen?</br>Also did anything happen between you and your date?</br></br>2017-05-12 12:38</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I was dancing out front to get people inside for the feed and I tripped</br>I can't believe that I made it out of a drunk boat in heels without hurting myself and then flats are what killed me</br>But yeah it hurts like a bitch and its swollen as fuck</br>And we were getting kinda touchy on the walk back but nothing beyond that</br>Which is fine, he's technically my student and I have no idea if there are rules about that</br>But I sent him that picture for approval and he liked it and said he had fun and stuff</br>I haven't responded</br>I think I'm gonna ask if he wants to come to the iBBQ on saturday</br></br>2017-05-12 12:58</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Did you like him?</br>But I'm sorry about your ankle that sucks</br></br>2017-05-12 12:59</br>Rosemary Adams</br>It's okay I'm using it as an excuse to not do anything</br></br>2017-05-12 12:59</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>But asking him to another event will definitely come across as if you do so be aware</br></br>2017-05-12 01:00</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I think I do</br>Idk, we didn't actually talk about much besides info</br>I'm okay with him thinking that. I still get the impression that he doesn't spend too much time thinking about stuff like that anyways.</br>Do you think that's too much though</br>2 events in a week</br></br>2017-05-12 01:24</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Too ate I did it</br></br>2017-05-12 05:48</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Okay should i wear separates or blue dress + necklace</br></br>2017-05-12 05:48</br>Rosemary Adams</br>HM</br>It's not as bright outside as I thought it would be</br></br>2017-05-12 05:49</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>True but our formal is indoors</br></br>2017-05-12 05:50</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I really like the blue combo</br></br>2017-05-12 05:56</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Do you think it's fancy enough?</br>I could also wear my black and white checkered one but that's not a springy vibe</br></br>2017-05-12 05:58</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I feel like the black checkered one is the same level of fancy as the blue one though</br>and that necklace is bomb af</br></br>2017-05-12 05:59</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>No way the black one is way fancier</br>Maybe it's just the materials</br>The blue one feels kind of cheap but if it doesn't look cheap then it probably doesn't matter</br></br>2017-05-12 06:00</br>Rosemary Adams</br>It doesn't look cheap to me</br>that with nude pumps</br>🔥</br></br>2017-05-12 07:36</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Is Carson going to the bbq tomorrow?

Also how do you know him? I feel like I need more backstory</br></br>2017-05-14 12:49</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I liked him!</br>He's bald and plays music though so I am cautious</br>He's in Info, he's friends with Ethan (IUGA President) and he was my student last quarter</br>I knew he was going through some shit last quarter because his grades took a dive and so I reached out and asked Ethan if he was okay but that was it</br>And then he was on the boat</br>idk</br>I haven't messaged him, he hasn't messaged me</br>I'm not sure if I want to do anything more than date casually and within Info is dangerous so I'm not putting lots of stock in this all but it was just a lil blow to the ego</br>Which is fine</br>My ego can take it lol</br>I don't think I'm gonna message him</br>Today anyways</br>?</br></br>2017-05-14 01:01</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>That seems fair, maybe just wait for him</br></br>2017-05-14 01:09</br>Rosemary Adams</br>What are you doing for mothers day?</br></br>2017-05-14 01:11</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Nothing, basically, I had too much going on this weekend to go home</br>I'm skyping her later</br>What about you?</br></br>2017-05-14 01:11</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Moms coming to Seattle for dinner</br>She even offered</br>it was great</br></br>2017-05-14 08:21</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Alrighty updates</br>He messaged me</br>I don't think we're going to see each other again</br>but the good news is it's not cause he thinks I'm boring</br>so that's good</br></br>2017-05-14 08:23</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>what did he say?</br></br>2017-05-14 08:25</br>Rosemary Adams</br>That he's on some new meds and doesn't think he should see people until he's readjusted</br>I'm glad he said something tbh</br></br>2017-05-14 08:26</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Ah well that's probably a good decision</br>not what I was expecting</br>but yeah you can date other, more stable, guys for now</br></br>2017-05-14 08:27</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Or no one!</br>I'm thinking no one for now</br>I really need to find an apartment and that is the number one priority atm</br></br>2017-05-14 08:28</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>look through the UW housing page and/or make a post</br></br>2017-05-14 08:28</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I can't make a post dude</br>But I will look</br>and conveniently Ethan is looking for a roommate</br></br>2017-05-14 08:29</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>wait who is Ethan?</br></br>2017-05-14 08:29</br>Rosemary Adams</br>IUGA president</br></br>2017-05-14 08:29</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>ah</br>fun</br>Weren't you going to live with Madison or Brendan also?</br></br>2017-05-14 08:30</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Well neither Madison or I can make a post about anything, so that might not happen, and Brendan already signed his lease for next year</br></br>2017-05-14 08:30</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>is he just living alone?</br></br>2017-05-14 08:30</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Ethan has a house with like 4 people they just need a fifth</br></br>2017-05-14 08:30</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>that would be good</br>plus a house would be more fun</br></br>2017-05-14 08:30</br>Rosemary Adams</br>right</br>I messaged him</br>John is one of the roommates but since we ended things honestly super well I don't see it being an issue</br></br>2017-05-14 08:31</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>who is john</br></br>2017-05-14 08:31</br>Rosemary Adams</br>the guy I went out with</br></br>2017-05-14 08:31</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Oh yeah haha oops</br>that's kind of awkward but would probably be fine</br>you should maybe check with him first though</br></br>2017-05-14 08:32</br>Rosemary Adams</br>He really doesn't want a fifth roommate at all</br>says the room itself is kinda crappy</br>but also</br></br>2017-05-14 08:32</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>would they just leave it empty?</br></br>2017-05-14 08:32</br>Rosemary Adams</br>living with people I like in an actual house with minimal effort</br>he wants to make it a game/music space</br>but it would cost everyone extra</br>plus honestly we made our dorm room space hella nice with some trickery so I bet I could do that again</br></br>2017-05-14 08:33</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>that space was already nice though</br>small, but corner room!</br>But, if he's saying he doesn't want a fifth roommate it might be uncomfortable to push that on him?</br></br>2017-05-14 08:33</br>Rosemary Adams</br>okay I suppose I phrased that incorrectly</br>He doesn't want one but understands that people don't want to pay more</br>so it's less of an aggressive opinion</br></br>2017-05-14 08:34</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Do you want me to post in my page to see if anyone is still looking for a roommate?</br></br>2017-05-14 08:35</br>Rosemary Adams</br>YES</br>omg yes please that would be amazing</br></br>2017-05-14 08:35</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>You might not know the people but I can gauge their roommate qualitiies for you</br></br>2017-05-14 08:36</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Fine by me</br>I trust you and am feeling kind of desperate</br>Although I did find housing in like August last time so who knows</br></br>2017-05-14 08:38</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>okay I made a post</br>true</br>but that was also an operpriced studio</br>so hopefully wont repeat that one</br>I left you anonymous</br>lol someone said they're looking for someone only for the summer THATS NOT HELPFUL</br></br>2017-05-14 08:40</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Haha thank you so much</br>Feel free to tell them I'm you're old roommate if that increases people's confidence</br></br>2017-05-14 08:41</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>okay I'll let you know if I get any takers</br></br>2017-05-14 08:53</br>Rosemary Adams</br><3</br></br>2017-05-14 08:54</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Oh how was gotg2???</br></br>2017-05-14 08:54</br>Rosemary Adams</br>AMAZING</br></br>2017-05-14 08:54</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>YAY</br></br>2017-05-14 08:54</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I would be down to go again if you want</br>#thirdwheek</br></br>2017-05-14 08:54</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I told carson we need to see it since you saw it without me, and apparently he's never seen the first one???!</br></br>2017-05-14 08:54</br>Rosemary Adams</br>WAT</br></br>2017-05-14 08:54</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>so he has to watch that one first</br></br>2017-05-14 08:55</br>Rosemary Adams</br>then we can all go</br>because I like you both</br>and want to see it again</br></br>2017-05-14 08:55</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>hahah that works too</br>We'll have to make time to see the first one first though because that is crucial</br>I can't believe he's never seen it it's so important</br></br>2017-05-14 08:56</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I know right</br></br>2017-05-14 08:56</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br></br>2017-05-14 08:57</br>Rosemary Adams</br>haha yes there is another super necessary shirtless scene</br></br>2017-05-14 08:57</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>perfect</br></br>2017-05-15 11:48</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Anyone say anything?</br>I got home because working on homework was giving me stress out the ears and now a sister posted a 5 paragraph manifesto calling exec tyrannical</br>and commenting on how shitty the sisterhood is</br>I am so out of here</br></br>2017-05-16 12:35</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>No I haven't heard anything</br></br>2017-05-16 12:35</br>Rosemary Adams</br>bother</br></br>2017-05-16 12:35</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Yeah I think it's time to abandon the ship</br></br>2017-05-16 12:35</br>Rosemary Adams</br>but the good news is I found a 6 person townhouse and know 4 people plus me who need a place so I'm touring it tomorrow</br>ayy</br></br>2017-05-16 12:36</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Woo</br>That'd he cool</br></br>2017-05-16 02:36</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Can I come cry on you later</br></br>2017-05-16 02:41</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>About what?</br>I'm currently super stressed out about school so I'm not in the best place to be offering emotional support but I can try</br></br>2017-05-16 02:59</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Oh no it's okay don't worry about it</br>I don't want to add to your load</br></br>2017-05-16 03:05</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>It's okay I can handle slightly more on my load</br>Is it about sorority things?</br></br>2017-05-16 04:24</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Yeah</br>Life things</br>I may have found a place to live next year though so that's nice</br></br>2017-05-16 06:46</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>aww okay</br>but yay! I'm glad that worked itself out pretty quickly</br></br>2017-05-16 09:02</br>Rosemary Adams</br>lots of messaging though</br>I am 195% burnt out and done with this quarter</br>This whole house can go die in a hole</br></br>2017-05-16 09:03</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>three more weeks!</br></br>2017-05-16 09:03</br>Rosemary Adams</br></br>2017-05-16 09:03</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br></br>2017-05-16 09:03</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I love you</br>the stupidity of people just frustrates me to no end</br></br>2017-05-16 09:04</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Love you too <3</br>what are stupid people doing</br></br>2017-05-16 09:04</br>Rosemary Adams</br>just being hurtful and mean</br>and invading my room again late at night</br>tbh madison keeps joking that we should get a place together and I am very done with the amount of drama she pulls to our room</br>and I know that's all circumstantial but like holy shit</br>It's just nonstop</br>I am considering going home tomorrow night and just staying</br></br>2017-05-16 09:13</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Yeah that's fair, I imagine that gets very hard to escape/live with</br>She probably wouldn't be able to pull it into an apartment but who knows if you want to take that risk</br>Would you just commute to classes? That's not a horrible idea, it's not ideal but I did it over the summer and it's definitely doable, especially for just a few weeks</br>But that also sucks because you're paying for housing</br></br>2017-05-16 09:18</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Eh, that part is minimal compared to the serious emotional labor going on. It started to impact my grades last week and this week is not better at all. In fact three weeks ago I was like it can't get worse but it has consistently gotten worse.</br>I'm just glad to get a game plan together for next year</br>I am so much happier knowing there will be an end</br></br>2017-05-16 09:31</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>God that's so sad</br>but yeah it really doesn't sound like the house is a good living environment at all</br>And you're right at a certain point you just have to cut your losses</br></br>2017-05-16 09:33</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Yeah. I don't have anything in common with these people, never hang out with them, and I don't think I will ever see them past college so whats the point</br>On one hand it sucks to quit but I'm seriously suffering</br>So it doesn't make me feel too bad</br></br>2017-05-16 09:33</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Yeah I wouldn't call it quitting at this point, you definitely tried pretty hard for a while</br>At a certain point it's just making a decision for your own mental health</br>And if you're not even getting the bare minimum of friendship benefits from your sorority then what's the point</br>What changed recently that made everthing get worse?</br></br>2017-05-16 09:36</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I feel so gross all the time while I'm there. Like, infected with spite and hateful energy</br>We had to call the cops on Friday</br>and then we kicked astrid off exec and she is making us out to be the huge bad guys to everyone</br>like my little is friends with her</br>and then this whole manifesto last night</br></br>2017-05-16 09:37</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>What was the manifesto?</br></br>2017-05-16 09:37</br>Rosemary Adams</br>rebecca straight up told astrid and valentina to reconsider their membership in the house</br>a random chick posted 5 paragraphs about how shitty we run chapter and how crappy everyone is and about how exec is tyrannical</br></br>2017-05-16 09:38</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>"a random chick"?</br></br>2017-05-16 09:38</br>Rosemary Adams</br>girl in the house</br>she "lives in"</br>but just lives with her boyfriend</br>was philanthropy chair for a quarter last year, and now is graduating</br></br>2017-05-16 09:38</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>ah so she's not very involved  and doesn't really know what's going on</br></br>2017-05-16 09:39</br>Rosemary Adams</br>yep</br>and is like oh we need to be better sisters</br>like</br></br>2017-05-16 09:39</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>But god that's so shitty I don't even know what I would do if a member posted that</br></br>2017-05-16 09:39</br>Rosemary Adams</br>come around sometimes maybe and help</br>right?!</br>everyone was liking it and commenting "oh thanks for saying something i totally agree" blah blah blah</br></br>2017-05-16 09:39</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>UGH</br></br>2017-05-16 09:39</br>Rosemary Adams</br>exec is tired as fuck</br></br>2017-05-16 09:39</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>why even try</br>thankless bastards</br></br>2017-05-16 09:40</br>Rosemary Adams</br>the seniors made a huge divide and now they are complaining about the sisterhood</br></br>2017-05-16 09:40</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Can you send me a screenshot?</br></br>2017-05-16 09:40</br>Rosemary Adams</br>yeah hold on</br></br>2017-05-16 09:40</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I kind of just want to get upset for you</br>But yeah you shouldn't really make a post explainig about how your sisters suck and in the same breath say that you should all get along</br></br>2017-05-16 09:41</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Pt 1</br></br>2017-05-16 09:42</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Pt2</br></br>2017-05-16 09:42</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Pt3</br></br>2017-05-16 09:42</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Pt4</br></br>2017-05-16 09:43</br>Rosemary Adams</br>She came to exec once during week two of winter quarter and that was after the attendance policy fiasco where we were trying to deal with hordes of angry people</br></br>2017-05-16 09:47</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Wow that is a manifesto</br></br>2017-05-16 09:47</br>Rosemary Adams</br>seriously</br>like a 99 theses of sisterhood</br>whatever luther</br>you don't even live here</br>Worst part is people loved it</br></br>2017-05-16 09:58</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I feel like overall it makes sense, in the sense that she's right that people aren't getting along and having a positive attitude and being nice is important</br>I'm not sure how accurate or not the whole "chapter is run like a tyrrany" thing is</br></br>2017-05-16 09:59</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I like to think it's not accurate</br></br>2017-05-16 09:59</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>but it seems like she could have left that part out and then just made a generally positive sisterly post but had to take a stab at exec in the meantime</br></br>2017-05-16 10:00</br>Rosemary Adams</br>yeah, and the context of everything she mentions is exec focused</br>"if you are upset with someone go talk to them"</br>or make a fb post about it lol</br></br>2017-05-16 10:00</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Idk how you guys run chapter but in ours people can speak if they want to but it's pretty formal, it's not like a casual conversation she seems to be wanting</br></br>2017-05-16 10:00</br>Rosemary Adams</br>We have a whole section for whatever people want</br></br>2017-05-16 10:01</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>So hopefully people are just agreeing to the "be nice to each other" part of the post?</br></br>2017-05-16 10:01</br>Rosemary Adams</br>and this last one we had to do a ceremony and a cultural event right at 7 so we tried to keep it short</br>but if they want longer than 3.5 hours then that is what they will get</br>Yeah but it's people like astrid and valentina who are so, so mean to people</br>idk</br>the sentiment was okay</br>but it made me feel like shit</br></br>2017-05-16 10:02</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Yeah that's fair</br></br>2017-05-16 10:02</br>Rosemary Adams</br>and was the last straw really</br></br>2017-05-16 10:02</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>You've been trying to improve all those aspects of the house and then you're getting blamed for being bad</br>I'd feel bad too</br>Fair enough</br></br>2017-05-16 10:02</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Kristen has been mostly quite about it too</br>I try not to blame her for everything but she is a weak leader</br>who has had exec beg her to do more and has refused</br>so this is what we have now</br></br>2017-05-16 10:08</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Yeah it does seem like the house is falling apart around her</br>idk if that's just because I hear everything from you or what</br>But there's a lot to deal with and it doesn't seem like she's dealing with any of it</br></br>2017-05-16 10:09</br>Rosemary Adams</br>That's the way it feels to me</br>and I'm so tired that I can't do anything anymore</br>I sent an email to advisors telling them we are dying and they brushed it off, even when I detailed exactly how we were going to die, beginning with exec members leaving</br>Kelsey has threatened to kill her roommate, we had to call the cops and file a report, and our advisers refuse to tell her parents until we have lawyers</br>it's just so fucked</br>and Kristen is happy to have her hands tied but the rest of exec is sick of it</br></br>2017-05-16 10:15</br>Rosemary Adams</br>and I am just sad all the time and have pretty much disengaged so</br></br>2017-05-16 10:16</br>Rosemary Adams</br></br>2017-05-16 10:20</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Yeah it's not a good sign when exec is dropping the house</br></br>2017-05-16 10:27</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I just don't belong and it sucks</br></br>2017-05-18 07:19</br>Rosemary Adams</br></br>2017-05-18 07:21</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>hahaha thank you <3</br>How are things with you?</br></br>2017-05-18 07:22</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Better now that I am house hunting lol</br>But we are kicking kelsey out of the house today</br>So I have to be around to deal with that and I really don't want to :(</br></br>2017-05-18 07:24</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>That's kind of sad because she's clearly having a hard time, mentally, but also she definitely shouldn't be living with this many people</br>But yeah that sounds rough I'm sorry you have to manage that</br></br>2017-05-18 07:25</br>Rosemary Adams</br>It's okay</br>It will be over soon</br>I just hope my grades don't tank again because I just got on top of them</br>The ultra good news is Matt gave me my dress back today and it was kind of awkward but not ultra awkward</br>We shook hands</br>He seemed happy</br>So that made me happy</br></br>2017-05-18 07:26</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Was that the first time youve seen him?</br></br>2017-05-18 07:27</br>Rosemary Adams</br>No I saw him a week (?)</br>ago</br>That was really awful</br></br>2017-05-18 07:27</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I'm glad he seems good now</br>aw why was that one awful?</br></br>2017-05-18 07:28</br>Rosemary Adams</br>It was the first time seeing him since the breakup</br>He wanted to be together still, and so it was just like a mini second breakup</br>and then it felt like he wanted me to take responsibility for his emotions as we were going through this</br>and I was like uuuuhh</br>how about I deal with myself first</br></br>2017-05-18 07:33</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Yeah that sounds hard</br>Not too surprising but it's sad that he still wanted to be together</br>But I'm glad the second meeting went better</br></br>2017-05-18 07:44</br>Rosemary Adams</br>How are you?</br></br>2017-05-18 07:45</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I'm good, i had a physics midterm tuesday and I have a biochem midterm tomorrow so I've basically just been locked in my room

hookups so you don't necessarily need him if he's gonna be shitty</br></br>2017-05-20 11:50</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Exactly</br></br>2017-05-21 08:24</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Can I put you down as a

12:36</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Damn how did she even get exposed</br></br>2017-05-22 12:36</br>Rosemary Adams</br>No idea</br>She doesnt even go out</br></br>2017-05-22 12:37</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Did she just get diagnosed?</br></br>2017-05-22 12:38</br>Rosemary Adams</br>No she is unconfirmed but shes sick and her neck is swollen</br>Everyone is freaking out</br>Luckily she pretty much quarintines herself away in her room anyways</br>But I am nervous because exec meetings happen in her room</br>I'm not sure if I should go home or what</br></br>2017-05-22 12:54</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>She should definitely go to hall health and get tested asap</br>and definitely go around and sanitize the house</br></br>2017-05-22 12:57</br>Rosemary Adams</br>We've done that in a panic</br>she went to take a test and we aren't letting her back in the house until she goes to hall health</br>we are trying to hold chapter somewhere else too</br></br>2017-05-22 12:58</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>damn brutal, probably necessary though</br>and she goes home all the time anyway right so just maybe just ask her to move home for good?</br></br>2017-05-22 12:59</br>Rosemary

Adams</br>that's what I'm thinking</br>exec has been the most exposed by far, but with so much house stuff going on Kristen has interacted with more members than usual</br>uugh</br></br>2017-05-22

ethan why I was glad another girl was living with him and he really wasn't getting it lol</br>you put it perfectly</br>He suggested I stay in my sorority if I like living with women so much</br>but holy hell</br>no way</br></br>2017-05-22 01:13</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>hahaha one other woman is very different from a whole housefull</br>especially just with what's going on at AEphi</br></br>2017-05-22 01:14</br>Rosemary Adams</br>seriously</br>omg</br>new stuff</br>so Madison said that there were going to be two public apologies at chapter today</br>which is kind of cryptic but we also knew exactly who she was talking about</br>valentina and astrid were charged with apologizing for what happened at formal</br>which I was honestly really looking forward to</br>It was going to be great</br>but then the next day Madison said that the apologies weren't happening because astrid and valentina decided to contest</br>which means going to freaking nationals with this issue</br></br>2017-05-22 01:25</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>to contest their standards punishment? so that goes to nationals? How does that work?</br></br>2017-05-22 01:27</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I honestly don't really understand it but I think our advisor and team captain have to move forward with the case to like a national council</br>and it takes forever</br>over a public apology and social probation</br></br>2017-05-22 01:28</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>jesus what's even the point</br>they're just being difficult for fun now</br></br>2017-05-22 01:30</br>Rosemary Adams</br>bingo</br>they are betting on nationals being lenient and slow</br>and they were both commenting on that huge manifesto about sisterhood last week too</br>OH</br>so we are having elections today right</br>and we kicked kelsey out of the house this weekend</br>which was so fucked up</br>and so at chapter today we were supposed to have two apologies, a statement from christy (who wrote the manifesto), a letter from Kelsey because she isn't allowed to be in the house anymore, a statement from sarah o about kelsey</br>and elections</br>and then a "directed mediated conversation" led by sarah o about the sisterhood</br>point is a lot of stuff</br>and so kristen posted in our announcement page saying hey long chapter don't make plans</br>and the same people who wanted a longer chapter last week were bitching about having homework to do!!!</br></br>2017-05-22 01:36</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>of course</br></br>2017-05-22 01:42</br>Rosemary Adams</br>it's gonna be a shit show</br></br>2017-05-24 05:27</br>Rosemary Adams</br>The only thing I was worried about about leaving the house was leaving my little</br>But it turns out her and Astrid are good friends now</br>And my annoyance with Astrid grows every time I see her face</br>So I don't feel so bad anymore</br></br>2017-05-24 05:58</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>That's good,  sad that you and your little aren't close but at least you can cut ties</br></br>2017-05-24 05:59</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Yeah if I were staying I would put more effort in but we are both quite busy and I don't feel like explaining why I don't like Astrid. If she likes her that's her own business.</br>I don't know if I can keep this to myself over summer though, my frustration is mounting every day</br></br>2017-05-24 06:07</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Why not just withdraw over the summer/ now?</br></br>2017-05-24 06:12</br>Rosemary Adams</br>If I did it now I would have to move out right now and I dont have time to commute with final projects due next week</br>Over summer I think it would be easier to room with my president and another exec member if I kept it to myself</br></br>2017-05-24 06:13</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Oh yeah I forgot you're living with them</br>That'll be tense</br></br>2017-05-24 06:13</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Yep</br>And I am so pissed these days that being kind about it will be difficult</br>So I was thinking that I would disaffiliate the say before I left for amsterdam</br></br>2017-05-24 08:29</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>lol that would work</br>they'll never know what hit them</br>In other news Carson told me he's going to be gone for the first three weeks of summer and the last 2 and I'm sad because I was already stressed about the summer and this just makes it worse</br>And he's leaving directly after his last final so we wont even be able to hang out post finals which for some reason is making me particularly sad</br>I'm also on my period which actually makes me hormonal now so I just took a two hour stress nap despite getting a full 8 hours last night</br></br>2017-05-24 08:37</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Oh lordy zoe</br>I'm sorry :(</br>I believe in you two</br>But its not gonna be fun or easy</br>How many weeks do you have together then?</br></br>2017-05-24 08:39</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>basically two and a half</br>plus one week when it's also work week at the sorority</br></br>2017-05-24 08:40</br>Rosemary Adams</br>:(</br></br>2017-05-24 08:41</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>AND I'm gonna be gone for the entire new season of game of thrones 😭</br>I finally had somebody to watch it with and now we can't even watch it together</br></br>2017-05-24 08:41</br>Rosemary Adams</br>It just keeps getting worse!</br></br>2017-05-24 08:41</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I know</br></br>2017-05-24 08:42</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Well on the bright side we can hang out, and wine wendesdays are back!</br></br>2017-05-24 08:42</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>true!</br></br>2017-05-24 08:42</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Sucks that they probably won't actually be on Wednesdays but thats okay</br></br>2017-05-24 08:43</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>that's okay</br>but also Ben was always the flakiest one so it might not be worth rescheduling if it causes issues</br>although it wouldn't change anything for me to do it another day of the week</br></br>2017-05-24 08:44</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Yeah it doesn't change anything for me to move it so I don't see why we shouldn't</br></br>2017-05-24 08:45</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>yeah we should just pick a day and be consistent</br>and maybe not take 6 hours?</br>but we can revise that later</br></br>2017-05-24 08:46</br>Rosemary Adams</br>We can open negotiations about the time later</br></br>2017-05-24 08:46</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>haha true</br>I'm glad PJ's sticking around!</br>I feel bad that we never hung out after the formal</br></br>2017-05-24 08:46</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Me too, he even has two cats now!</br></br>2017-05-24 08:46</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>it's been so long</br>WHAT</br>HOW WAS I NOT INFORMED</br></br>2017-05-24 08:47</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I told you now didn't I?</br>Kalani told me yesterday</br>or a couple days ago</br>or something</br></br>2017-05-24 08:47</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>kept a secret a whole couple days</br>wow</br>this is what betrayal feels like</br></br>2017-05-24 08:47</br>Rosemary Adams</br>friendship ruined</br></br>2017-05-24 08:47</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>are they kittens?</br></br>2017-05-24 08:47</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Not sure</br></br>2017-05-24 08:48</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>that's important info</br></br>2017-05-24 08:48</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I think Kate got them and so since she's going back to school for a semester next year PJ will have them</br>and be alone in an apartment :(</br></br>2017-05-24 08:48</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>aw</br></br>2017-05-24 08:48</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I can invite him to my place!!!</br>omg I am so excited for this freaking how</br></br>2017-05-24 08:48</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>we should try to force him to hang out with us</br></br>2017-05-24 08:48</br>Rosemary Adams</br>house</br></br>2017-05-24 08:48</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>have you oficially gotten it yet?</br></br>2017-05-24 08:48</br>Rosemary Adams</br>we can invite him to the next ballet if you want</br>Yep!</br>We need to sign stuff still but we have all been approved</br></br>2017-05-24 08:58</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>yay!

life</br></br>2017-06-01 10:45</br>Rosemary Adams</br></br>2017-06-01 10:45</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Actually the whole article was pretty dang on point</br>"Article"</br>Pictures of other peoples writing</br>Still on point</br></br>2017-06-01 10:51</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Hahaha I'm glad you felt validated</br></br>2017-06-01 10:52</br>Rosemary Adams</br>it was nice</br>Also yesterday I was walking home and this guy comes running up behind me and stops and is like hey I thought you looked cute and wanted to talk to you</br>internally I was like bitch I don't owe you a conversation because you evaluated my external shell and found it to be of your liking</br>but externally I was just really awkward</br>and so then he starts walking with me and asking me what year I'm in and what my major is</br>so I say informatics</br>and he's like whats that</br>so I give him the elevator pitch about the major and what I'm doing with it and hes like</br>Oh I didn't think you would be doing software, you look like you would be more creative</br>bruh</br>I couldn't tell if he was hitting on me or trying to insult me</br>so internally I am like BRUH</br>but externally I am still just super awkward</br>and am like oh I am also a dancer</br>he liked that a lot more</br>and then he proceeds to walk me all the way to my house and is like hey you wanna get coffee sometime</br>and in my infinite wisdom I'm like uhhhh</br>you can add me on facebook if you want</br>lo and behold he doesn't have one</br>so he suggests I take his number and then makes some dumb comment about how it feels like he's being picked up while putting it in my phone</br>and I'm like you literally asked to do this like</br>wat</br>so that happened</br>Idk how I feel about the whole thing</br>because on one hand that guy has guts I guess</br>but on the other hand I hate entertaining guys who I did not invite into my space</br></br>2017-06-01 11:02</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Hm</br>Well it doesn't seem like you liked him too much so maybe just go with don't text him</br></br>2017-06-01 11:03</br>Rosemary Adams</br>That was the plan</br>This whole event has made me question where it fits into my feminist philosophy</br></br>2017-06-01 11:05</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>The software engineering comment was definitely sexist,  but idk if the cold approach itself screams of the patriarchy</br>Would've been less objectifying if he hadn't made it about your appearance and just said hi though</br></br>2017-06-01 11:08</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Very true very true</br>bleh</br>I'm so stressed I think I'm gonna die</br></br>2017-06-01 11:11</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>About this?</br></br>2017-06-01 11:13</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Oh man no, just school</br>Like there aren't enough hours in the day</br>I haven't had

general for like 30 years and since she was retiring it was like our sendoff</br>She was really happy about it</br>And then she came to pledging yesterday!</br>I've never seen somebody actually so interested in all our ritual secrets lol</br>Apparently after all this time in the house she'd never actually been in our chapter room</br></br>2017-06-01 11:26</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Wow, that is so sweet!!</br></br>2017-06-01 11:27</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Yeah it was cute I'm glad we did it</br>Even though I had to memorize a ton of things</br>She said she wanted to get involved in the alumni chapter back home</br></br>2017-06-01 11:28</br>Rosemary Adams</br>aww omg</br>You'll be more prepared for initiation next year as a result, hopefully</br></br>2017-06-01 11:33</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Yeah true, doing all this now will make it easier in the fall for sure which is nice</br>And it's definitely helped me procrastinate on studying for physics</br></br>2017-06-01

who's back</br>Back again</br></br>2017-06-06 01:04</br>Rosemary Adams</br>DAMN</br>this dude</br></br>2017-06-06 01:04</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Legit four years later</br>Still at it</br>One date during this whole time</br></br>2017-06-06 01:05</br>Rosemary Adams</br>this is what we call</br>the long game</br></br>2017-06-06 01:05</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Literallt</br></br>2017-06-06 01:05</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Did you tell him you have a boyfriend?</br></br>2017-06-06 01:05</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I checked his fb and he and his girlfriend broke up</br></br>2017-06-06 01:05</br>Rosemary Adams</br>ahhhhh gotcha</br></br>2017-06-06 01:05</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I honestly just panicked and didn't respond</br></br>2017-06-06 01:05</br>Rosemary Adams</br></br>2017-06-06 01:06</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Because I feel like if I pull the boyfriend care he'll be all "Oh I just wanted to hang out"</br></br>2017-06-06 01:06</br>Rosemary Adams</br>ugh yeah I hate that</br></br>2017-06-06 01:06</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Idk what to say though</br>I don't really care about him though so that's why I went with nothing</br>But that seems mean</br></br>2017-06-06 01:08</br>Rosemary Adams</br>well you can either just never respond, which is I think a totally valid option, and could honestly keep this saga going on endlessly</br>or you can do the "oh yeah totally!"</br></br>2017-06-06 01:09</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>He has liked  both my Insta pics featuring Carson though so he has some idea</br></br>2017-06-06 01:09</br>Rosemary Adams</br>and then never plan it</br></br>2017-06-06 01:09</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Hahaha that's exactly what I was thinking</br>That's basically been the move I've pulled on this guy every time</br>I just ghost on him infinitely</br>But I felt weird doing that since I am actually in a relationship</br>So I kind of feel like I shouldn't set up dates even with the complete intention of not attending</br></br>2017-06-06 01:11</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Fair fair</br>But also like</br>this dude</br>I really enjoy the perpetual chase</br></br>2017-06-06 01:11</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>It is kind of fun</br>How long can one dude maintain a crush on me</br></br>2017-06-06 01:12</br>Rosemary Adams</br>FOREVERRR</br></br>2017-06-06 01:12</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>He's definitely the record holder</br>I've given him so little to base this crush on too he really barely knows me</br></br>2017-06-06 01:13</br>Rosemary Adams</br>He has evaluated your exterior shell</br>and found it to his liking</br>perhaps reviewed your resume</br></br>2017-06-06 01:13</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>True</br></br>2017-06-06 01:13</br>Rosemary Adams</br>hm actually when you think about it that way I am not a fan</br>send him a ghost emoji and never talk to him agaain</br></br>2017-06-06 01:15</br>Rosemary Adams</br></br>2017-06-06 01:15</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Hahahah omg that would be great</br>I'm leaning more towards never respond</br></br>2017-06-06 01:15</br>Rosemary Adams</br>GHOST EMOJI</br></br>2017-06-06 01:16</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Plus I told him I was going to bed so I could just be asleep</br></br>2017-06-06 01:16</br>Rosemary Adams</br>or DEAD</br>now a ghost</br></br>2017-06-06 01:16</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Good point</br>But that seems to overtly mean</br></br>2017-06-06 01:16</br>Rosemary Adams</br>dude</br>but also I really want this to be a thing like 5 years from now still so</br></br>2017-06-06 01:18</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I know 😂</br>Okay I should go to bed for reals but thanks for your support</br></br>2017-06-06 01:19</br>Rosemary Adams</br>of course</br>good luck on your final!!!!</br><3</br></br>2017-06-06 01:19</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Thank you!</br>I'm excited for the ballet</br>Good stuff</br></br>2017-06-06 01:19</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br></br>2017-06-06 12:19</br>Rosemary Adams</br></br>2017-06-06 12:21</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>I feel like it might be better to not make blatant sex jokes with your ex, as funny as they are</br></br>2017-06-06 12:21</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Idgaf</br></br>2017-06-06 12:22</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Fair. Does he want to meet up again?</br></br>2017-06-06 12:22</br>Rosemary Adams</br>I'm not trying to meet up with him so I'm not gonna tell him when I'm actually done</br>Yeah thats my guess</br>And it was this or a really savage meme about ignoring texts from your ex</br></br>2017-06-06 12:22</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Hahaha</br>That would've been good too</br></br>2017-06-06 12:23</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Oh lord he said "we should totes catch up"</br>TOTES</br>totes matt</br></br>2017-06-06 12:23</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Does he just still hope you guys will get back togethrt?</br></br>2017-06-06 12:23</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Totes</br>I have no idea</br></br>2017-06-06 12:23</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>WHAT</br>Lol</br>Is he 13</br></br>2017-06-06 12:23</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Lol yes</br>He wants to be friends I think?</br>In the hopes of getting back together probably</br></br>2017-06-06 12:24</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>That can be good, but also you guys have had your time</br>And yeah the ulterior motive would sour the friendship</br></br>2017-06-06 12:25</br>Rosemary Adams</br>Plus I'm not interested in being friends with him</br>Like I could not see that working for either of us</br></br>2017-06-06 12:27</br>Zoe Thuesmunn</br>Yeah I can't either really</br>A good call</br></br></body>
